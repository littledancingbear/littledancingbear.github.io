<FONT SIZE=+2>Always be</FONT>

<BR>
<BR>

In the early morn
<BR>
when you hear the bird song
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
<BR>
Though the night be long
<BR>
I will always comfort
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
<BR>
And though the night be dark
<BR>
Inside your frightened heart
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
<BR>
In my son's smile
<BR>
Though the winds be wild
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
<BR>
In any star that shine
<BR>
In every friend of mine
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
<BR>
Though I must leave
<BR>
If you believe
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
I will always be
<BR>
<BR>
On a brand new dawn
<BR>
Or in the wind's song
<BR>
Or when the roses come

<P>Most of you may not have heard of David Knopfler while many may know
his brother Mark, who is with Dire Straits when he is not on his own.</P>

<P>David initially founded <A HREF="http://www.knopfler.com/DSFAQ.html">Dire Straits and played with the band on their first two albums</A>. Afterwards he left the band to walk his own path
of music. A <A HREF="http://www.addict.com/MNOTW/95-12-27.html">journalist</A>
summed up this period of David's career as follows:</P>

<UL>
<P>David Knopfler (born 1952) is a guitar player who graced the first
two Dire Straits albums. Unfortunately, it was his brother Mark who wrote
the songs, sang them, and got to play all the lead guitar. Which maybe
explains why Dave graced only those two Dire Straits' albums</P>
</UL>

<P>His brother must have observed him quite a bit because it's David
who comes up with the marvellous ideas which Dire Straits adopted in their
work later. Commenting on David's latest CD &quot;small mercies&quot;,
a journalist wrote: this is the music Mark Knopfler would have liked to
come up with. Well, he may be right but that doesn't bother David much
these days, I guess. </P>

<P>By the way, he wrote an immensely enlightening short book on the
record industry called &quot;Bluff your way in the rock business&quot;
and it's available on his web-site, the address of which is given below.</P>

<P>The outcome of David's travels through his musical mind is documented
on 7 CDs so far, all of which are highly recommended for two reasons at
least</P>

<UL>
<LI>David is an excellent singer-songwriter who produces music with
a rich texture and exquisite flavor.</LI>

<LI>David's development as a musician is amazing, his songs and his
voice have matured and he has acquired a quality of personal development
aiming at fully realizing his artistic and human potential simultaneously.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The first 5 CDs of David's opus (published on his own label Paris Records) are <A HREF="http://www.knopfler.com/">available on his web-site</A> to which you are referred below. Their titles are (check the sequence of titles and you'll get an idea of the story-teller DK):</P>

<UL>
<LI>Release (1983)</LI>

<FONT SIZE=-1>This album is reviewed as follows:
<BR>
This early solo album from David Knopfler has a strong Dire Straits flavor, particularly "Madonna's Daughter," where Mark Knopfler contributes his unmistakable rhythm guitar. However, David Knopfler's strong, sandpaper vocals and the gentle orchestral feel of some of the tracks make this album distinctly his own: "Sideshow" has a rocky, dance-almost-disco rhythm, there's some interestingly-dirty sax work on "Come to Me," and the recording closes with a memorable, late-night love song "The Great Divide." ~ Ali Sinclair, All-Music Guide</FONT>
</UL>

<LI>Behind the lines (1985)</LI>

<LI>Cut the wire (1986)</LI>

<LI>Lips against the steel (1988)</LI>

<LI>Lifelines (1991)</LI>
</UL>

<P>The latest CDs <A HREF="davidk1.htm">&quot;The Giver&quot;</A> (1993)
and <A HREF="davidk1.htm#dk-sm">&quot;small mercies&quot;</A> (1994) are
both available on his <A HREF="http://www.knopfler.com">web-site</A> or with CDnow and other well assorted record shops. </P>

<P>Besides his music, David has become a prolific writer of <A HREF="http://www.guitar9.com/columnindex3.html">comments
on the music industry</A>, the Internet and electronic communication (check
his web-site). I understand he still loves his Apple (sigh!). And he is
frequently mentioned in one of the most exciting <A HREF="http://www.willa.com/">web-sites</A> I've come across.</P>

I appreciate his work very much
<BR>
because it is the expression of a complex human mind and soul - 
<BR>
what more can we ask for in a world
<BR>
becoming increasingly narrow-minded and cold-hearted?
</CENTER>

<CENTER>
Thank you so much, David!
