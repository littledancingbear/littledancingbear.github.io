<P>The Soviet constitution guarantees everyone a job. A pretty scary idea,
I'd say.<BR>

<P>The Institute of U.S. and Canadian Studies is supposed to have subscribed
to the &quot;Village Voice&quot; for six years in an attempt to find out
about life in America's rural areas.<BR>

essays and (other) outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 54<BR>

<P>I'm a registered Republican and consider socialism a violation of the
American principle that you shouldn't stick your nose in other people's
business except to make a buck.<BR>

essays and (other) outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 45<BR>

<P>These were people who believed everything about the Soviet Union was
perfect, but they were bringing their own toilet paper.<BR>

essays and (other) outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 45<BR>

<P>Smoking cigarettes seems to alarm peace activists much more than voting
for Reagan does.<BR>

<P>Anything that makes your mother cry is fun.<BR>

</P>

<P>I mean, so what if some fifty-eight-year-old butt-head gets a load on
and starts playing Death Race 2000 in the rush-hour traffic jam? What kind
of chance is he taking? He's just waiting around to see what kind of cancer
he gets anyway. But if young, talented you, with all of life's possibilities
at your fingertips, you and the future Cheryl Tiegs there, so fresh, so
beautiful - if the two of you stake your handsome heads on a single roll
of the dice in life's game of stop-the-semi - now that's taking chances!
Which is why old people rarely risk their lives. It's not because they're
chicken - they just have too much dignity to play for small stakes.<BR>

essays and (other) outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 129<BR>
</P>

<P>The real slums are another matter. The bad parts of Tondo are as bad
as any place I've seen, ancient, filthy houses swarmed with the poor and
stinking of sewage and trash. But there are worse parts - squatter areas
where people live under cardboard, in shipping crates, behind tacked-up
newspapers. Dad would march you straight to the basement with a hairbrush
in his hand if he caught you keeping your hamster cage like this.<BR>

<P>Freddie Aguilar, who's billed as &quot;the Bob Dylan of the Philippines&quot;.
This is unfair, since he's good-looking, plays the guitar well, can carry
a tune, and writes songs that make sense.<BR>

essays and (other) outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 87<BR>
</P>

<P>To really enjoy drugs you've got to want to get out of where you are.
But there are some wheres that are harder to get out of than others. This
is the drug-taking problem for adults. Teenage weltschmerz is easy to escape.
But what drug will get a grown-up out of, for instance, debt?<BR>

essays and (other) outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 29<BR>
</P>

<P>A child growing up in an excessively safe environment may never learn
that he is one - not until he gets married and has a wife to tell him so.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1987), Republican Party Reptile. The confessions, adventures,
essays and other outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 41<BR>
</P>

<P>The forces of safety are afoot in the land. I, for one, believe it is
a conspiracy - a conspiracy of Safety Nazis shouting &quot;Sieg Health&quot;
and seeking to trammel freedom, liberty, and large noisy parties. The Safety
Nazis advocate gun control, vigorous exercise, and health foods. The result
can only be a disarmed, exhausted, and half-starved population ready to
acquiesce to dictatorship of some kind.<BR>

essays and other outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 41-42<BR>
</P>

<P>Something is happening to America, not something dangerous but something
all too safe. I see it in my lifelong friends. I am a child of the &quot;baby
boom&quot;, a generation not known for its sane or cautious approach to
things. Yet suddenly my peers are giving up drinking, giving up smoking,
cutting down on coffee, sugar, and salt. They will not eat red meat and
go now to restaurants whose menus have caused me to stand on a chair yelling,
&quot;Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, dinner is served!&quot; This from the
generation of LSD, Weather Underground, and Altamont Rock Festival! And
all in the name of safety! Our nation has withstood many divisions - North
and South, black and white, labor and management - but I do not know if
the country can survive division into smoking and non-smoking sections.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1987), Republican Party Reptile. The confessions, adventures,
essays and other outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 40<BR>
</P>

<P>In fact, safety has no place anywhere. Everything that's fun in life
is dangerous. Horse races, for instance, are very dangerous. But attempt
to design a safe horse and the result is a cow (an appalling animal to
watch at the trotters.) And everything that isn't fun is dangerous too.
It is impossible to be alive and safe. <BR>

essays and other outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 41<BR>

<P>Neither conservatives nor humorists believe man is good. But left-wingers
do.<BR>

<P>Every generation finds the drug it needs.<BR>

<P>Drugs are a one-man birthday party.<BR>

<P>Man developed in Africa. He has not continued to do so there. <BR>

<P>Fishing ... is a sport invented by insects and you are the bait. <BR>

essays and (other) outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 203<BR>
</P>

<P>The America's Cup is like driving your Lamborghini to the Grand Prix
track to watch the charter buses race.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 150 <BR>
</P>

<P>There are a lot of mysterious things about boats, such as why anyone
would get on one voluntarily.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 151 <BR>
</P>

<P>In Western Australia they don't even know how to make that vital piece
of sailing-boat equipment, the gin and tonic.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 152 <BR>
</P>

<P>Earnestness is just stupidity sent to college.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 12 <BR>
</P>

<P>The larger the German body, the smaller the German bathing suit and
the louder the German voice issuing German demands and German orders to
everybody who doesn't speak German. For this, and several other reasons,
Germany is known as 'the land where Israelis learned their manners'.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 16 <BR>
</P>

<P>War will exist as long as there's a food chain.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 13 <BR>
</P>

<P>Civilization is an enormous improvement on the lack thereof.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 13 <BR>
</P>

<P>I'm sure they were looking for a person who embodied democratic spirit,
intellectual excellence and the American ethos, which is why they picked
Prince Charles.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 159 <BR>
</P>

<P>And Harvard has been almost as important to the American Jewish community
as the pork-sausage industry.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 159 <BR>
</P>

<P>The world is built on discrimination of the most horrible kind. The
problem with South Africans is they admit it.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 167 <BR>
</P>

<P>Sailing-boat racing can be interesting. So was Altamont.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 156 <BR>
</P>

<P>The Australian language is easier to learn than boat talk. It has a
vocabulary of about six words.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 154 <BR>
</P>

<P>Stars &amp; Stripes captain and future White House guest Dennis Conner
was there, also in a bad tux. He looked like a poster child for the Penguin
Obesity Fund.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 154 <BR>
</P>

<P>The purpose of the spinnaker is, I believe, to give the sponsor some
place where he can put the name of his company in really gigantic letters.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 155 <BR>
</P>

<P>I've always figured that if God wanted us to go to church a lot He'd
have given us bigger behinds to sit on and smaller heads to think with.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 103 <BR>
</P>

<P>To grasp the true meaning of socialism, imagine a world where everything
is designed by the post office, even the sleaze.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 90 <BR>
</P>

<P>One nice thing about the Third World, you don't have to fasten your
seat belt. (Or stop smoking. Or cut down on saturated fats.) It takes a
lot off your mind when average life expectancy is forty-five minutes.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 82 <BR>
</P>

<P>Cockfighting has always been my idea of a great sport - two armed entr&eacute;es
battling to see who'll be dinner.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 118 <BR>
</P>

<P>Everything on a boat has a different name than it would have if it weren't
on a boat. Either this is ancient seafaring tradition or it's how people
who mess around with boats try to impress the rest of us who actually finished
college.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 149 <BR>
</P>

<P>I am no stranger to loud music. I've been to a Mitch Ryder and the Detroit
Wheels concert. I once dated a woman with two kids. <BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 147 <BR>
</P>

<P>Some people are worried about the difference between right and wrong.
I'm worried about the difference between wrong and fun. <BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 125 <BR>
</P>

<P>Everyone's very busy, though not exactly working.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 26 <BR>
</P>

<P>The interesting thing about staring down a gun barrel is how small the
hole is where the bullet comes out, yet what a big difference it would
make in your social schedule.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 23 <BR>
</P>

<P>If Christ came back tomorrow, He'd have to change planes in Frankfurt.
Modern air travel means less time spent in transit. That time is now spent
in transit lounges.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 18 <BR>
</P>

<P>They don't like anyone who isn't Korean, and they don't like each other
all that much, either. They're hardheaded, hard-drinking, tough little
bastards, 'the Irish of Asia'.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 54 <BR>
</P>

<P>What would be a road hazard anywhere else, in the Third World is probably
the road.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 78 <BR>
</P>

<P>Italy is not technically part of the Third World, but no one has told
the Italians.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 78 <BR>
</P>

<P>Even when they don't know what they're doing, they're doing so much
of it that they're still going to get an A.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 58 <BR>
</P>

<P>Moscow has changed. I was here in 1982, during the Brezhnev twilight,
and things are better now. For instance, they've got litter. In 1982 there
was nothing to litter with.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 261 <BR>
</P>

<P>I can understand why mankind hasn't given up war. During a war you get
to drive tanks through the sides of buildings and shoot foreigners - two
things that are usually frowned on during peacetime. <BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 261 <BR>
</P>

<P>The most extraordinary change in Moscow was Arbat Street, the USSR's
first pedestrian mall. Of course, there's something a little sad about
a pedestrian mall in a nation where few people own cars - the whole damn
country's a pedestrian mall.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 262 <BR>
</P>

<P>The Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work and
then gets elected and proves it.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 270-271 <BR>
</P>

<P>The entire Soviet service economy is conducted in geological time. <BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 264 <BR>
</P>

<P>The French are a smallish, monkey-looking bunch and not dressed any
better, on average, than the citizens of Baltimore. True, you can sit outside
in Paris and drink little cups of coffee, but why this is more stylish
than sitting inside and drinking large glasses of whiskey I don't know.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 199 <BR>
</P>

<P>The Italians have had two thousand years to fix up the Forum and just
look at the place.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 194 <BR>
</P>

<P>There are probably more fact-finding tours of Nicaragua right now than
there are facts - the country has shortages of practically everything.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 211 <BR>
</P>

<P>It had never occurred to us that the Kremlin's new anti-booze campaign
would apply to journalists. Now, that's a human-rights violation.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 225 <BR>
</P>

<P>I like to do my principal research in bars, where people are more likely
to tell the truth or, at least, lie less convincingly than they do in briefings
and books.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1989), Holidays in hell. London (Picador), 212 <BR>
</P>

<P>There's only one secret to bachelor cooking - not caring how it tastes.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 45<BR>
</P>

<P>A steady job is at least as deleterious to the spirit of bachelorhood
as a steady date. Some jobs are worse than actual wives.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 42<BR>
</P>

<P>Never serve oysters during a month that has no paycheck in it. <BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 55<BR>
</P>

<P>Despite the fact that meat is made from dead animals, it shouldn't smell
that way. Try this test for meat freshness: close your eyes and see if
you can tell the pork chops from a gym locker.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 54<BR>
</P>

<P>For some mysterious Darwanian reason, women feel compelled to straighten
up bedrooms before and after sex. Try to make love in every other room
of the house.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 28<BR>
</P>

<P>Keeping house is as unpleasant and filthy as coal mining, and the pay's
a lot worse.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 5<BR>
</P>

<P>Even newlyweds don't spend much time together, now that few marriages
outlast the appliance warranties.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 5<BR>
</P>

<P>You can keep the dining room clean by eating in the kitchen.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 21<BR>
</P>

<P>Cleaning, like seduction, should be done from the top down - starting
with the ceiling, which is ridiculous. Gravity takes care of that. <BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 15<BR>
</P>

<P>Women make their beds each morning and they assume everyone - criminals
on the lam, animals in their burrows - does the same. <BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 87<BR>
</P>

<P>Lemon juice, an important ingredient in Bloody Marys and other forms
of liquid breakfast. Makes fish taste as if it was grown on trees. And
improves, immensely, the taste of lemons.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 60<BR>
</P>

<P>The real truth about children is they don't speak the language very
well. They're physically uncoordinated. And they are ignorant of our elaborate
ideas about right and wrong.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 128-129<BR>
</P>

<P>Bachelors know all about parties. In fact, a good bachelor is a living,
breathing party all by himself. At least that is what my girlfriend said
when she found the gin bottles under the couch. I believe her exact words
were, &quot;You're a disgusting, drunken mess.&quot; And that's a good
description of a party, if it's done right.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 90<BR>
</P>

<P>A good bachelor drinks his dessert (and sometimes the rest of his meals).
A sweet tooth is a danger signal that you're getting too much exercise
and not enough cocktails.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 59<BR>
</P>

<P>The only really good vegetable is Tabasco sauce. Put Tabasco sauce in
everything. Tabasco sauce is to bachelor cooking what forgiveness is to
sin.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 57<BR>
</P>

<P>You have to wonder about a food that everybody agrees is great except
that sometimes it tastes like what it is.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 55<BR>
</P>

<P>Coffee and cigarettes are much better if you want an instant breakfast.
<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 58<BR>
</P>

<P>Remember, your body needs 6 to 8 glasses of fluid daily. Straight up
or on the rocks.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1993), The bachelor home companion. A practical guide to
keeping house like a pig. Sydney (Picador), 57<BR>
</P>

<P>Traffic was like a bad dog. It wasn't important to look both ways when
crossing the street; it was important to not show fear.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1994), All the trouble in the world. The lighter side of
famine, pestilence, destruction and death. Sydney (Picador), 336<BR>
</P>

<P>Asia is the continent rhythm forgot. At best Asian music is off-brand
American pop, like Sonny Bono in a karaoke bar. At worst Asian music sounds
as if a truck full of wind chimes collided with a stack of empty oil drums
during a birdcall contest.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1994), All the trouble in the world. The lighter side of
famine, pestilence, destruction and death. Sydney (Picador), 338<BR>
</P>

<P>I'd like to end the book a lot of ways. Except I don't have any answers.
Use your common sense. Be nice. This is the best I can do. All the trouble
in the world is human trouble. Well, that's not true. But when cancer cells
run amok and burst out of the prostate and take over the liver and lymph
glands and end up killing everything in the body including themselves,
they certainly are acting like some humans we know.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1994), All the trouble in the world. The lighter side of
famine, pestilence, destruction and death. Sydney (Picador), 339-340<BR>
</P>

<P>Saigon is like all the other great modern cities of the world. It's
the mess left from people getting rich.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1994), All the trouble in the world. The lighter side of
famine, pestilence, destruction and death. Sydney (Picador), 331<BR>
</P>

<P>Personally, I believe a rocking hammock, a good cigar, and a tall gin-and-tonic
is the way to save the planet.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1994), All the trouble in the world. The lighter side of
famine, pestilence, destruction and death. Sydney (Picador), 104<BR>
</P>

<P>The people who believe that, as a result of industrial development,
life is about to become a hell, or may be one already, are guilty, at least,
of sloppy pronouncements. On page 8 of <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, Al
Gore claims that his study of the arms race gave him &quot;a deeper appreciation
for the most horrifying fact in all our lives: civilization is now capable
of destroying itself.&quot; In the first place, the most horrifying fact
in many of our lives is that our ex-spouse has gotten ahold of our ATM

of ancient Athens, who had a civilization remarkable for lack of technological
progress during its period of greatest knowledge and power, managed to
destroy them fine.<BR>

<P>When government does, occasionally, work, it works in an elitist fashion.
That is, government is most easily manipulated by people who have money
