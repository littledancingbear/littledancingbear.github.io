<p>
Taxpayers are paying tobacco companies to develop high-tar, "higher 
puff count" cigarettes for export to Africa, and to reduce production
costs, despite the Government's much-touted national strategy to reduce
smoking.  

<p>
The revelation follows a long struggle by the Australian Medical 
Association to get information from the Industry Minister, Senator 
Minchin, on research and development grants, culminating in the 
Government's refusal to disclose funding levels.  

<p>
The AMA president, Dr David Brand, said the Government finally 
responded to a freedom of information request, but blanked out the 
amount of cash granted.  

<p>
The documents disclose Philip Morris's research and development tax 
concession claims for work on the long, high-tar cigarette for Africa, new
filters to improve "sensory characteristics and satisfaction", a new
machine to make cigarettes more quickly, and a small cigarette called
Mighty Mouse.  

<p>
The revelation exposes the lack of any "public interest test" for R and D
funding, or any ban on taxpayer-funded research into anti-social products
for export.  

<p>
The issue is also difficult for Labor, which began the R and D scheme 14
years ago, and the Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, admitted yesterday that
tobacco companies could also get taxpayer funding under Labor.  

<p>
But he said new policies meant a Labor government would restrict R 
and D subsidies to "the new industries that we need ... I strongly 
suspect that cigarettes don't come into that category".  

<p>
However, Senator Minchin refused to ban funding to tobacco 
companies and rejected any public interest or morality test on R and D
subsidies.  

<p>
"This is the first time I've heard it suggested that the Government 
should discriminate against any industry that pays tax," he said. 
"Everyone is treated equally in the company tax system, and this is a
company tax deduction, in effect.  

<p>
"Governments decide what products can be legally produced and what 
products can't. At the same time we warn our citizens of the dangers of
smoking. These two must and should coexist in a free society. There is no
case for discrimination - what other industries would then be subject to
this moral approval?"  

<p>
Asked whether the Government should subsidise research on 
dangerous products for export to poor countries without rigorous 
warnings, he said that "there might be a whole range of products which
can't be sold in Australia but are designed for export ... that would be
an extremely difficult line to draw and policy to apply".  

<p>
Dr Brand replied that "if someone said now 'We have a product that will
kill 18,000 Australians a year and cost the community $12.7 billion a
year' there'd be a riot - the Government has just got to start acting on
the biggest health problem in this country after indigenous health".  

<p>
A spokeswoman for the Health Minister, Dr Wooldridge, who 
negotiated a national anti-tobacco strategy with State health ministers
two years ago, said: "It's a decision that's been made in the industry
portfolio - the health portfolio is doing its bit to reduce smoking in the
community."  

<p>
The NSW Federal Liberal MP Dr Brendan Nelson called for an 
immediate funding ban.  

<p>
"There is no justification at all for giving away taxpayer money for
anything other than reducing tobacco consumption. If the Government's got
this cash to spend it should spend it on anti-smoking campaigns."  

<p>
The Professor of Public Health at Sydney University, Professor Simon
Chapman, said funding for anti-smoking campaigns had fallen under the
Coalition, which had also failed to act on promises to force tobacco
companies to tell consumers what was in cigarettes.  

<p>
"Michael Wooldridge is personally extremely committed, but he's 
completely outnumbered by the people in Cabinet who say tobacco is 
like any other product."  

<p>
A spokesman for Philip Morris said the company got $1.3 million in tax
concessions between 1995 and 1998.
