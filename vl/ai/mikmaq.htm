Why this page from a <a href="http://www.ldb.org/biodata.htm">German citizen living in Australia</a>? If I'd only knew. This is all the result of a magic development of the past years when I got involved in Indigenous Peoples in Australia and North America. Eventually, I felt I should set up a web-page about the beautiful people I worked with, and here's one on the Mi'kmaq. Others deal with the <a href="http://www.ldb.org/vl/ai/salish.htm">Salish Kootenai and Pend d'Oreille</a> and with <a href="http://www.ldb.org/oz-indi.htm">Indigenous Peoples of Australia</a>.

<p>
Guess, this is my humble tribute to these Peoples who I owe the deepest respect and admiration. Thanks for the lessons you're teaching me - ldb.</font>
