        <BR>

        (University of California Press, 1996) </B> 
        <P> I always welcome research on contemporary Native American life. Few 
          people, beyond this population itself, know very much about the lives 
          of Native Americans today. Sociologist Jeanne Guillemin has made the 
          observation that in the popular imagination, &quot;Indians [a]re located 
          in another dimension of time--the past.&quot; In an interview I conducted 
          a few years ago in San Francisco, the director of the local Indian Center 
          reiterated this view, by explaining to me that people do not accept 
          &quot;Indians&quot; as such,if they are not wearing &quot;beads and 
          feathers.&quot; She added, &quot;We are not accepted by non-Indians 
          as a contemporary people.&quot; 
        <P> To expect contemporary Native Americans to live as their ancestors 
          did is no different from expecting African Americans to do the same, 
          and yet no one would think that African American identity rests on the 
          adoption by contemporary blacks of the dress and lifeways of their African 
          ancestors. Whatever reasons most Americans have for thinking of &quot;Indians&quot; 
          as part of a mythical past, or as a people frozen in time, this image 
          of Indians presents a number of problems for the current Native American 
          population. Theresa DeLeane O'Nell's book highlights some of those problems, 
          by linking identity, culture, and depression among the members of the 
          Flathead Tribe of Montana. 
        <P> O'Nell brings many facts about modern reservation and Native American 
          existence to light. Her book offers a comprehensive overview of various 
          aspects of this existence, from structural (economics, social provisions) 
          to cultural (communality, kinship) factors. One factor which is often 
          unknown to most Americans, but is an important issue in the lives of 
          Native Americans living on reservations or other areas where they are 
          the principal racial minority, is the factor of racism and discrimination 
          they encounter from whites. Rarely does one hear about this issue with 
          respect to Native Americans, but it is an ongoing reality. (I have found 
          this to be true in my own field research among Native American people, 
          both on reservations and in urban areas. For these individuals, racism 
          is manifested in much the same way as it is for African Americans--from 
          violence against them, to discrimination in housing and jobs.) If one 
          is to gain a greater understanding of Native Americans, these factors 
          must be taken into account, and O'Nell is to be commended for including 
          them in her study. 
        <P> O'Nell focuses on issues of identity and culture among the Flatheads 
          in order to contextualize their experiences of what she calls &quot;depressive 
          like affect.&quot; Her project is to apply a culturally-specific analysis 
          of the symptoms associated with this condition, and to avoid a direct 
          adoption of Euro-American notions of depression as a framework for understanding 
          the particular ways in which depression-related emotions are experienced 
          among the Flatheads. In constructing her analysis, O'Nell devotes a 
          significant portion of her book to a discussion of Indian identity. 
        <P> &quot;Indian&quot; identity is a much-contested topic among academics, 
          Native americans, and members of the general population. Questions about 
          this identity start from the basic issue of categorization, i.e., is 
          &quot;Indian&quot; identity racial, ethnic, or cultural? But this identity 
          is also questioned in terms of its history, its inclusiveness, and its 
          relationship to other identities concerning Native Americans, such as 
          tribal identities, or its usage compared with such terms as &quot;Native 
          American,&quot; &quot;Native,&quot; or tribal names. Unfortunately, 
          O'Nell does not examine these questions and issues in relation to her 
          discussion of &quot;Indian&quot; identity,and she seems to frequently 
          conflate &quot;Indian&quot; identity with Flathead (tribal) identity. 
          Part of the problem here is that the author doesn't adequately contextualize 
          her research with the Flatheads in terms of other Native American groups, 
          or in terms of the general Native American population. 
        <P> To her credit, O'Nell does examine the contested nature of what it 
          means to be &quot;Indian&quot; among the group she studies, focusing 
          on the anxiety and confusion among Flatheads concerning their status 
          in relation to what she refers to as &quot;real Indians.&quot; (This 
          is not a problem only for the Flatheads; in my own research among the 
          Chippewas of Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota, &quot;Indian&quot; 
          is neither a clear nor agreed upon identity.) The root of confusion 
          around this identity is the contradiction inherent in the concept of 
          &quot;Indian&quot; itself. The principal contradiction derives from 
          the image of &quot;Indians&quot; as static cultural entities (an issue 
          which O'Nell draws attention to) who, in order to claim this identity, 
          must live and dress like their ancestors of past centuries. Since &quot;Indians&quot; 
          have not lived in a social and cultural vacuum in this country and the 
          US government has made aggressive and concerted efforts to destroy indigenous 
          culture, these individuals simply cannot live up to such a conception 
          of what an &quot;Indian&quot; is. 
        <P> A second contradiction is the lack of clarity as to whether &quot;Indian&quot; 
          is a racial, ethnic, or cultural identity. This only adds to the confusion 
          for individuals about the meaning of this identity. O'Nell correctly 
          points out that the issue of &quot;authenticity&quot; for Flatheads 
          (and I would say, for Native Americans in general) as &quot;Indians&quot; 
          creates a state of insecurity regarding their feeling of &quot;belonging,&quot; 
          the condition of belonging being one which O'Nell asserts is critical 
          for the Flathead people. 
        <P> Herein lies one of the problems with this book. O'Nell attempts to 
          place Flathead &quot;depressive-like affect&quot; in the context of 
          Flathead culture. Yet, because she does not provide comparative studies 
          as at least a backdrop for her analysis of Flathead &quot;depression,&quot; 
          I found myself asking if and why the issues of identity and belonging 
          were particularly unique to the Flatheads. (In fact, there are considerable 
          similarities between O'Nell's findings about the Flatheads and my findings 
          about the Turtle Mountain Chippewa with respect to many issues, including 
          cultural ones. For example, the communal nature of the reservation society, 
          the extended-kinship system, the value of caring for others and sharing 
          among the community, are all qualities which I found among Turtle Mountain 
          Chippewa.) Beyond Native American groups, the reader is left wondering 
          if much of what O'Nell concludes regarding Flathead depression is applicable 
          to other groups, such as African Americans, particularly concerning 
          the meaning and effects of racism for them. Thus, it is the specificity 
          with which she frames her analysis to the Flathead experience which 
          is problematic, and which could have been remedied by offering at least 
          some comparative research with other groups. 
        <P> There is one other problem with this study concerning methodology 
          and data. O'Nell does not provide a schedule of the questions she asked 
          her interviewees (of which there were thirty-three), nor is there any 
          detail on the specific characteristics of these individuals. In a footnote, 
          the author claims that she made an &quot;effort to achieve a balance&quot; 
          in terms of age and other characteristics for her sample, but adds that 
          she makes no claims as to the &quot;representativeness&quot; of this 
          sample. This qualification is troublesome given the fact that, throughout 
          her book, O'Nell makes sweeping generalizations about the Flathead Reservation 
          population concerning her research findings, presumably based on this 
          sample. Moreover, she often makes assertions about subjective Flathead 
          feelings, for which she provides no evidence. The reader must therefore 
          take on faith that O'Nell's attributions of certain thoughts and feelings 
          to Flatheads are based on research evidence which is not presented. 
          The lay reader may overlook this, but for a social scientist, it represents 
          a critical flaw in the presentation of the research. 
        <P> There is a great deal of worthwhile information contained in O'Nell's 
          book, and her study does shed light on some important issues concerning 
          Native americans. Additionally, her project is a sound one, in that 
          she does question the universal application of psychological concepts 
          developed in one culture to other cultures. Nonetheless, the book as 
          a work in social scientific research, suffers from serious shortcomings. 
          Particularly when studying groups who have been misrepresented in research 
          due to the racism or ethnocentrism of the social scientific community 
          of the past, it is of paramount importance today for a researcher studying 
          such groups to carefully substantiate her claims and findings about 
          them. Unfortunately, the author fails in this critical task.
