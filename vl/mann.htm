<P>
Jonathan Mann died on Wednesday, September 2, in the crash of 
an airplane bound from New York to Geneva, where he was to attend 
a World Health Organization conference. He was 51. His wife, 
Mary Lou Clements-Mann, also perished. She had been a visiting professor 
of international health at Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) during 1997.

<P>A world-renowned researcher and champion of human 
rights, Mann joined the school's faculty in 1990 as professor in 
epidemiology and international health. In 1993, he was appointed the 
first 
Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Bagnoud professor of health and human rights and 
founding 
director of the Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and 
Human Rights. This past January, Mann left HSPH to assume the deanship of 
the school of public health of the Allegheny University of 
Health Sciences in Philadelphia.

<P>Mann received his undergraduate education at Harvard 
College, graduating in 1969, before earning his MD at Washington 
University School of Medicine in 1974. Following medical school, he 
worked as an epidemiologist in New Mexico for the US Public 
Health Service and the New Mexico Health Services Division.

<P>Following a return to HSPH to earn his MPH degree in 
1980, Mann began to apply his intellect and skills to forming 
international strategies for reducing and preventing the spread of AIDS. 
He founded and directed Project SIDA, an AIDS research 
project based in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly 
Zaire), that incorporated epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory 
components in a collaborative effort of Zairian, US (Centers for 
Disease Control), and Belgian AIDS researchers. In 1986, Mann 
founded the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS, based 
in Geneva, Switzerland.

<P>While at HSPH, Mann continued to be involved in world 
AIDS issues, chairing the Global AIDS Policy Coalition, an 
independent research and advocacy organization, and editing two of the 
signal reports on the status of AIDS, <I>AIDS in the 
World</I> (Harvard University Press, 1992) and <I>AIDS 
in the World II</I> (Oxford University Press, 1996).

<P>His international experiences with AIDS policy brought to 
his attention the link between human rights and health. He was 
particularly interested in the effects of health policies on human 
rights, 
the health effects of human rights violations, and the inextricable 
connection between promoting and protecting health and rights. His 
suggestion began the HSPH commencement tradition of awarding each 
graduate 
a copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<P>Acting Dean James Ware said: "Jonathan was a powerful 
influence for widening the scope of public health to include the study of 
human rights. He led the way at Harvard, and the world followed. Between 
his work in this area, and his pioneering AIDS work in international 
communities, Jonathan's legacy is millions of healthier lives. 

<P>"He was a talented instructor and sought-after advisor. He 
inspired scores of students to the possibilities and satisfactions of a 
career in public health, and he inspired his faculty colleagues as well. 
We, and the world, will miss his enthusiasm, his guidance, and his passion for 
public health."

<P>
Mann is survived by his mother, Ida Mann, a sister and brothers, 
his former wife Marie-Paule, and his children Naomi, Lydia, and 
Aaron. A memorial gathering for the HSPH community will be held on Sunday, 
September 27, at 3:00 p.m. in the Kresge cafeteria.
