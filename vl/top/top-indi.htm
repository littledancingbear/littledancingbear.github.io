     lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and

     arising from the utilization of such knowledge, innovations and practices; 
<li>
     IBIN is currently in a pilot phase, and is being designed to both serve the private internal
     needs of Indigenous groups and to facilitate the sharing information publicly. It will work to
     foster communications among Indigenous groups globally, and to aid Indigenous peoples
     form their own locally appropriate communications plans.
<li>
     IBIN is not itself a policy-making organization or an information publisher, but will act to aid
     Indigenous organizations and networks form their own information sharing protocols and
     help make public information on the Convention on Biological Diversity and related
