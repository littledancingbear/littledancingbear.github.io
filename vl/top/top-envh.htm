This standard, which has come to be known as the Registered Environmental Health Specialist or Registered Sanitarian credential, evidences that one has mastered a body of knowledge (which is verified through the passing of an examination) and has acquired sufficient experience, thereby indicating that work responsibilities in the environmental health field can be satisfactorily performed. The pioneers of the association believed that such a credential was necessary if the environmental health field was to grow and take shape as a legitimate and widely respected profession.
