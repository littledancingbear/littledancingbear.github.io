<p>Unequal development in different countries in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a common danger.</p>

<p>Healthy development of the child is of basic importance; the ability to live harmoniously in a changing total environment is essential to such development.</p>

<p>The extension to all peoples of the benefits of medical, psychological and related knowledge is essential to the fullest attainment of health.</p>

<p>Informed opinion and active co-operation on the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the health of the people.</p>

<p>Governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures.</p>
</ul>
