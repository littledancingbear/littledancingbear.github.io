International Institute for Health Promotion (USA)</a>

- <i>"represents a growing network of leading institutions in health promotion from all over the world. In formulating the concepts for the IIHP, the intention was not to create another traditional professional association with a complex governing structure, and thus duplicating efforts by other renowned organizations. This approach was validated by the delegates at the Inaugural Meeting as they stressed the need for regular communication and to deepen personal relationships by meeting face-to-face.
<br>
This way joint ventures will bring forth an improved efficiency and higher success rate. In spite of the major cultural differences between countries, many similar health issues and common problems were clearly defined.
<br>
While being sensitive to cultural considerations international standards in training, research, and program development should be developed. In addition, the systematic monitoring of health trends and risk factors on a global basis and making these data available to the world will lead to natural partnerships in certain areas and enable many institutions to enlist support both within their respective countries as well as internationally"</i>
