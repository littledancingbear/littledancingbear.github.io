Many of the Pacific Islands have not yet put into place the infrastructure for 
extensive (and expensive) electronic communication. However, there are regional 
networks which provide access to resources on almost all of the islands. Here 
are several links to these networks which we found very useful:

Clinicians will find special materials they can use to personally recommend mammography and pap smears to their patients. Early detection can make a difference in treatment and survival"</i>

assistance which UNDP had provided in these early days, was instrumental in the 
formation of SOPAC as an independent regional organisation in 1984 and to its 
direct involvement in the execution of the Pacific Water Supply and Sanitation 
Programme. For some time the UNDP was looking for a "regional home" for its 
Pacific Water Supply and Sanitation Programme. The matter was considered by 
SPOCC (South Pacific Organisations Co-ordinating Committee) and in 1993 they 
agreed that SOPAC should be the lead agency for the UNDP-funded program, with 
the solid waste component sub-contracted to SPREP (South Pacific Regional 
Environment Program) and sanitation aspects to the SPC (South Pacific 
Commission)"</i>

Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies

- <i>"The rationale for the establishment of the School was essentially the 
growing awareness that Australia needed a sound understanding of the problems 
both of the 'Pacific Island neighbourhood', and the 'near North' of Southeast 
and East Asia. Asia and the Pacific remain a region of manifest importance to 
Australia and the School seeks to provide the intellectual community of 
Australia (government, media, other academics and the interested public) with 
an understanding of the societies and environments of the region. Achieving 
this purpose requires the cultivation of several interacting disciplines, based 
on solid evidence, appropriate time-depth and rigorous analysis. Work is carried
out on the Australian mainland in physical geography, archaeology and 
anthropology and Australia's relations with Asia and the Pacific Islands is an 
important theme in most fields"</i>

It does so in terms of particular intersections of global, regional, national, provincial and local contexts. A core concern is with the nature and problems of sovereignty in new, avowedly Christian nations, which were effectively colonial creations and had no overarching indigenous polities.
