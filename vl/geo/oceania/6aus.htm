NCCH's role in both morbidity and mortality classification will have a national scope. The focus of morbidity classification will be on inpatient and ambulatory services. NCCH is responsible for the development of ICD-10-AM, an Australian modification of the World Health Organizations' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems - Tenth Revision (ICD-10) which is accompanied by an Australian procedure classification. ICD-10-AM is currently being prepared by NCCH in consultation with clinicians and clinical coders with the aim of more accurately reflecting Australian clinical practice. ICD-10-AM is due for implementation for morbidity coding in July 1998. The Australian Bureau of Statistics plans to use WHO's ICD-10 publication for cause of death coding"</i>
