Dear WWW Virtual Library Public Health User,

<p>
you will be transferred to the web-page for Austria in 60 sec. I protest against the inclusion of neo-fascistic politicians into the Austrian Government. 

<p>
You may not agree with my decision, however, I do believe that it is the duty of a democrat to stand up against developments which may lead to the abandonment of democracy itself.

<p>
For your further information, please check <a href="http://www.haiderwatch.i-p.com/">HaiderWatch</a>, an Austrian web-site available in English.

<p>
As a result of this action, I received a couple of mails in which I was told that this step was naive and not justifiable. To these and potentially other writers, let me state the following:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font size=-1>
I am making a purely personal decison to take issue with Austria's political lurch to the right. I don't for a moment think for example that China trampling all over Tibet is okay. Of course atrocities are global and at times almost worryingly universal - - but two wrongs don't make a right - and there are specific historical precidents, and especially so for me, that make the present Austrian situation worth a private symbolic gesture. Are you suggesting that I can only privately protest about one political ill if I also post a litany of complaints about human frailties globally? When Ghandi took a quiet walk to the coast to collect a thimble full of salt, he was essentially minding his own business in a very non judgemental way but following his heart - that it happened to lead to the end of a particular tyranny, British rule in his country, was a whole other matter - he simply had to do what he had to do as, in my significantly more humble and less arduous way, do I.

"In Germany, the Nazis first came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I was not a Communist. 

<p>
Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I was not a Jew. 

<p>
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I was not a trade unionist. 

<p>
Then they came for the Catholics, but I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. 

<p>
Then they came for me, and by that time no one was left to speak up."
