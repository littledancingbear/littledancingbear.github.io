Hello CLICK4HP Readers,
<P>

This note is for people who may be uncertain about
'how to unsubscribe' or
'how to set your subscription to no-mail for a period of absence' or
'how to find out who else is on the list' or, most important -
how to contact the list-owners and facilitators!
<P>
Occasionally we see messages asking all 422 subscribers to this list to "unsubscribe" or "remove me from this mailing list". The task of changing your subscription or leaving CLICK4HP is best done by yourself.
<P>
The correct way to leave a list-serv that you have subscribed to is as follows:
<P>
1. Send a message to the listserver  **not to the list**  which in this case is
<P>
   LISTSERV@YORKU.CA.
<P>
2. Leave the subject line blank
<P>
3. In the message body type in
<P>
UNSUBSCRIBE CLICK4HP   or  SIGNOFF  CLICK4HP"
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
IF YOU WILL BE AWAY FOR A VACATION...
<P>
If you wish to leave CLICK4HP for an extended period, and not receive all the e-mail from the list while you are gone, you can either unsubscribe as above ;-((
<P>
OR you can change your subscription to 'nomail' and when you return you can get it back again. To do this, send a message to the LISTSERV address as above (listserv@yorku.ca), leaving the subject line blank,
and in the body message type in
<P>
SET CLICK4HP NOMAIL
<P>
When you return, send a message to LISTSERV address saying
<P>
SET CLICK4HP MAIL
<P>
and you will start hearing from us again!
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
WHAT ABOUT PAST MESSAGES?
<P>
Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a list  of the  available  archive  files by  sending  an "INDEX CLICK4HP" command to LISTSERV@YORKU.CA. You can then order these files
with a "GET CLICK4HP  LOGxxxx" command, or using LISTSERV's database search facilities. Send an  "INFO DATABASE" command for more information on the latter.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
WHO IS ON HERE ANYWAY?
<P>
Please note that  it is presently possible for anybody  to determine that you are signed  up to the list through the use of  the "REVIEW" command, which returns the e-mail address and name of all the subscribers. If you do not want your name to be  visible, just issue a "SET CLICK4HP CONCEAL" command.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
FOR MORE INFORMATION
<P>
For more  information about  subscription  options, send  a "QUERY CLICK4HP" command to LISTSERV@YORKU.CA. More  information on LISTSERV commands can be found in the
LISTSERV reference card, which  you can get by sending an "INFO REFCARD" command to LISTSERV@YORKU.CA.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
If you experience problems with unsubscribing, or posting, or have any questions about the list - please contact the list-owners!! You can do this by sending a message to  click4hp-request@yorku.ca  OR contact
the list-owners directly.
