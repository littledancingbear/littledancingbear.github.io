Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a>
- <i>"based in Princeton, N.J., is the nation's largest philanthropy devoted exclusively to health and health care. It became a national institution in 1972 with receipt of a bequest from the industrialist whose name it bears, and has since made more than $2 billion in grants. The Foundation concentrates its grantmaking in three goal areas: to assure that all Americans have access to basic health care at reasonable cost; to improve the way services are organized and provided to people with chronic health conditions; and to reduce the personal, social and economic harm caused by substance abuse--tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs"</i>

Halley, MD, MBA</a> and though it's located and grounded somewhere in Ohio, it provides rich resources on primary health care and public health. One should promote Gregory for the hard labor he has put into setting up this page. We need more of his kind indeed.</i>
