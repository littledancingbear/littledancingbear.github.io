Aboriginal Healing Foundation</a> - </font>"On January 7, 1998, the Government of Canada announced Gathering Strength - Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan, a strategy to begin a process of reconciliation and renewal with Aboriginal Peoples. A cornerstone of Gathering Strength was the Government’s commitment of $350 million to support community-based healing initiatives for Métis, Inuit and First Nations people on and off reserve who were affected by the legacy of physical and sexual abuse in Residential Schools. Following discussions with survivors, members of the healing community, the Assembly of First Nations, the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, the Métis National Council and the Native Women’s Association of Canada, the Aboriginal Healing Foundation was created as the entity to design, manage and implement the healing strategy under the terms outlined in a funding agreement with the Government of Canada which was signed by both parties on March 31, 1998"</li>

To train rural health care workers in Eastern Siberia, based on the principles of public health, to provide clean water, a good diet, and an environment free of infectious disease and parasites.

To focus attention upon the health care needs and capacities of rural indigenous women, and to provide opportunities for the professional development of indigenous health care providers, the vast majority of whom are women.

To adapt the experience of community health care workers in self-governing First Nations communities in Canada to the needs of health care workers in rural Siberia who are dislocated by the disintegration of the centralised state health care system.

To examine the potential for locally controlled diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis, alcoholism, intestinal parasites, and the
