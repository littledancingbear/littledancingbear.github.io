<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>Diana Gribble: </P>

<P><I>Welcome to the 1995 Boyer Lectures. I'm Diana Gribble.</I> </P>

<P><I>As Deputy Chair of the ABC Board, it's my pleasure to introduce this
year's Boyer lecturer, well known social policy commentator and activist,
Eva Cox.</I> </P>

<P><I>In the series, which she has named A TRULY CIVIL SOCIETY, Eva Cox
argues for a radical re-thinking of our definition of citizenship. She
argues that the citizenship debate is too narrow because it's dominated
by the notion that citizens are competitive individuals when in fact, people
are fundamentally social beings.</I> </P>

<P><I>Last week in her first lecture 'Broadening the Views', Eva Cox described
how the social had disappeared from debates on public policy. She made
a passionate argument for broadening our views beyond the economic frameworks
that dominate political debate.</I> </P>

<P><I>In today's lecture called 'Raising Social Capital', Eva Cox outlines
her ideas for increasing our stores of social capital, which she suggests
may well be the pre-requisite for economic growth.</I> </P>

<H2><B>Raising Social Capital</B> </H2>

<P>Eva Cox: </P>

<P>We invented money and, from the coins of precious metal, we created
a convenient fiction called finance. This fiction has unfortunately become
the ultimate public record of human connections - what we now call transactions.
</P>

<P>Journalists, treasurers and business lobbies use financial data as pressure
points to influence public decisions. We worry constantly whether our ill
defined Gross Domestic Product is growing too fast or not fast enough,
even though it measures only part of our production and wealth. </P>

<P>Finance capital movements determine exchange and interest rates and
usurp the roles of the sovereign state. Electronic pulses are invested
with so much meaning that they have the power to destroy governments and
increase the private affluence of a privileged few. </P>

<P>What is meant by wealth? Wealth has become a very disputed term, particularly
with the recent World Bank claims that Australia is the wealthiest country
in the world. Marilyn Waring, a New Zealand writer, described the faults
in measures of national production in her ground breaking book 'Counting
for Nothing'. Crime is counted, traffic accidents because of potholes are
not but car repairs are. Plantation trees are counted, self sown saplings
are not. If we sell sex, cooking and child care they are counted, but unpaid
housework is not. Growth in GDP, the Gross Domestic Product may come from
oil spills, bushfires, wars, epidemics or the destruction of wilderness.
GDP is actually reduced by lowering the road accident rate and by fewer
heart attacks. </P>

<P>The public finance system does not debit financial capital with the
destruction of physical capital such as the uncounted wealth of clean air,
water resources, trees and the rest of the natural world. So aspects of
daily living, such as unpaid production and gifts of time are not even
counted as part of the wealth of nations. </P>

<P>There are four major capital measures, one of which takes up far too
much policy time and space at present. This is Financial capital. Physical
capital makes it onto the agenda because of the environmental movement.
So there are fierce debates on trees, water, coal and what constitutes
sustainable development. Some types of physical capital and financial capital
deplete with overuse, or become scarce or too expensive. We occasionally
mention human capital - the total of our skills and knowledge - but rarely
count its loss in unemployment. </P>

<P>There has been too little attention paid to social capital - the last
of the four horseriders of another apocalypse. Social capital refers to
the processes between people which establish networks, norms, social trust
and facilitate co-ordination and co-operation for mutual benefit. These
processes are also known as social fabric or glue, but I am deliberately
using the term'capital' because it invests the concept with the reflected
status from other forms of capital. Social capital is also appropriate
because it can be measured and quantified so we can distribute its benefits
and avoid its losses. </P>

<P>We increase social capital by working together voluntarily in egalitarian
organisations. Learning some of the rough and tumble of group processes
also has the advantages of connecting us with others. We gossip, relate
and create the warmth that comes from trusting. Accumulated social trust
allows groups and organisations, and even nations, to develop the tolerance
sometimes needed to deal with conflicts and differing interests. </P>

<P>Therefore we must put a high priority on growing social capital by offering
opportunities for trust and co-operation. The social institutions which
govern and influence us must operate in ways which value diversity and
belonging. They must also be able to withstand debate and questioning.
</P>

<P>If the social system isolates people, discourages informal and formal
contact, or just fails to offer the time and space needed for social contact,
then social capital is under threat. Lack of time is an increasing problem
as time becomes commodified through ever longer hours of paid work. We
spend time in cars in isolation and there are increasing options for individual
working and leisure which intrude upon our once informal meeting times.
</P>

<P>We rarely have time to walk, we often avoid public transport because
it takes too long, we shop hurriedly and use technology to provide home
based entertainment and work. We need to make time for social interactions
and the development of trust relationships. What once happened by accident
needs to be recognised and encouraged. We need to examine how we can use
technology to enhance social capital, and we must look at lifestyles and
life cycles to make sure there is space and time . </P>

<P>Social capital should be the pre-eminent and most valued form of any
capital as it provides the basis on which we build a truly civil society.
Without our social bases we cannot be fully human. Social capital is as
vital as language for human society. We become vulnerable to social bankruptcy
when our social connections fail. If most of our experiences enhance our
sense of trust and mutuality, allowing us to feel valued and to value others,
then social capital increases. That is why I want to use the concept of
social capital as a major thread in these lectures. </P>

<P>In a recent article called <I>Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social
Capital</I>, American political scientist, Robert Putnam, describes the
need for a strong active civil society to make democracy work. He quotes
many studies that show a correlation between high levels of civic culture,
comfortable lifestyles and positive economic outcomes. </P>

<P>Putnam claims that the interactions which create social capital are
most likely to occur in egalitarian communities where people voluntarily
contribute time and effort and receive positive reinforcement. Experiences
which engender trust and a recognition of common ground, allow people to
move comfortably from the defensive 'I' to the mutual 'we'. A sense of
reciprocity, he claims, is more than just a utilitarian trading relationship.
It creates complex social relationships. </P>

<P>So spending time together, working co-operatively and enjoying each
others company create social capital. This seems to be heresy indeed. In
an age where competition is the only solution on offer , social capital
theory suggests another option: that humans achieve more by co-operating.
Indeed much of what we have, as a society, achieved has been by co-operation.
If co-operation works so well, we should be very, very wary of accepting
competition policies. </P>

<P>Putnam's work in regional Italy offers statistical evidence that co-operation
pays off socially, bureaucratically and economically. High levels of social
capital bring co-operation and the norms which may be called civic virtues.
These virtues in turn are the basis of truly civil societies where the
law rests lightly. If we trust others as we trust ourselves, prosperity
and economic growth tend to follow. </P>

<P>Social capital is the social glue, the weft and warp of the social fabric
which comprises a myriad of interactions that make up our public and private
lives - our vita activa. Distrust, loss of social cohesion and short term
self interest breed conflict and social isolation, demands for law and
order and a contempt for power and authority. </P>

<P>So how do we develop social capital? Putnam suggests it is the trust
we develop through active relationships with each other. Accumulated trust
is based, at least in part, on working together in 'civic' groups. These
are the familiar community groups: non-profit organisations such as P&amp;Cs,
local environment groups, Rotary, craft groups, neighbourhood centres,
local sporting groups, ethnic and religious groups, reading groups, fund
raising organisations, playgroups and others which have an egalitarian
voluntaristic structure. Such groups are generally run democratically:
people participate because they want to and their processes involve members
working together on tasks, developing trust and mutually rewarding relationships.
</P>

<P>Trust should be defined as inexhaustible because it is increased, rather
than depleted by positive use. The more we work together with others in
environments which encourage co-operation the more likely we are to trust
others, and the occasional failures of trust will be less damaging. Social
capital is therefore increased by use. It can be depleted by widespread
lack of trust or by our own failure to trust others. Without trust we avoid
contact with others because we fear betrayal. This is the core component
of social connections. </P>

<P>When people meet to clean up a city, a suburb or a local park, they
are amassing social capital. Indeed we amass social capital when we work
on the school fete, talk to our neighbours about the street plants, drop
off some soup to a sick friend, meet a regular group at tennis or bowls,
join a local choir, commit ourselves to making uniforms for the junior
sports group, arrange theatre parties, or whatever we do with friends and
sometimes strangers. </P>

<P>Even in paid work we may often want to give more than the minimum. There
is pleasure in providing a better service. It is a small gift to help,
to smile and to satisfy another. We do this not just for commercial reasons
but because as the shop assistant, nurse or car detailer we like the customer
and want to give them something extra. </P>

<P>Competing against each other leaves little space for reciprocity and
the growth of social capital. Running against another in a race may benefit
our speed, but jointly organising the sports day produces co-operation
and trust. There are many more situations where co-operation and reciprocity
are more effective than competition. Civic virtues come from building on
what we have in common rather than by using our differences to create in-groups,
out-groups and fear driven competition. </P>

<P>The value of belonging to voluntary organisations is often misinterpreted
by those on the political right who use Putnam's work to claim that we
should replace governments with voluntary organisations. This ignores Putnam's
point that it is not the auspice of the organisation that counts, but the
way it operates. Many of these groups on the Right are authoritarian in
structure and their organisations want to impose their norms on others.
</P>

<P>As Putnam says, and I quote:<I>'On the demand side, citizens in civic
communities expect and get better government... they are prepared to act
collectively to achieve shared goals. ...Most fundamental to the civic
community is the social ability to collaborate for shared interests. Generalised
reciprocity... generates high social capital. ...A conception of one's
role and obligations as a citizen, coupled with a commitment to political
equality, is the cultural cement of the civic community.</I> </P>

<P><I>Without norms of social reciprocity and networks of social engagement,
the Hobbesian outcome of the Mezzogiorno (southern Italy) - amoral familism,
clientelism, lawlessness, ineffective Government and economic stagnation
- seems likelier than successful democratisation and economic development.
Palermo may represent the future of Moscow.'</I> </P>

<P>Putnam's work shows that community groups, workplaces or other organisations
which are authoritarian and paternalistic do not create trust and civic
virtue. They distribute favours to the chosen and compliant, or demand
blind loyalty. The consequences are competitive and suspicious interactions.
Unity is created by identifying an outside enemy and closing ranks. Mafia
style patronage breeds competition - not cohesion. </P>

<P>What Putnam's data suggests is that the removal of Government - destroying
the legitimancy of its laws - may create gangs and militias as is occurring
in the USA. We need to remember that there is nothing naturally virtuous
in communal organisations nor anything inherently wrong with government.
</P>

<P>I was excited when I found Putnam's work because it offered a framework
for pulling together many of my diverse concerns. The idea of social capital
as a measure of the social health or otherwise of communities, societies
or nations has a certain unifying elegance. </P>

<P>However, I think his viewpoints are still too narrow. He focuses on
definable organisations which work formally in the public arena but he
does not include many informal groups. His limits view reflects the usual
masculinist assumptions about the separation of the public and private
spheres. </P>

<P>I want to extend the social capital concept to include the household
and informal sectors which can also create social trust relationships and
forms of civic wellbeing. I would include certain extended household operations,
neighbourliness and community support, all of which informally link people.
These informal help and support measures are functional as well as creating
recognition and identity. </P>

<P>Social capital accumulators work best as open systems which allow entry
for newcomers who may be different. Informal networks may cluster around
a formal institution such as a school or community centre, or less visible
locations like the house where people gather, a local shopping centre,
coffee shop, or places in parks. </P>

<P>These informal networks fit Putnam's model of democratic, egalitarian
web-like structures which offer shared positive experiences through collaboration.
These experiences provide a comfort zone for recognising our communalities
and choosing to look for collective rather than individual benefits. </P>

<P>There is another related area of possible accumulation of social capital
which struck me on reading Putnam. What he describes as civic culture is
very similar to what is increasingly being recognised as workplace culture.
Again, the rules and formal structures of workplaces may be similar, but
the actual cultures of staff relationships within workplaces may affect
the way the organisation works as well as how productive it is. </P>

<P>Some workplace cultures model open and relatively egalitarian relationships.
Others are closed and authoritarian, immune to change or to the entry of
outsiders. A level of collegiality and trust between workers creates workplaces
where authority is worn lightly but responsibly and productivity is high.
Where the workplace is redolent with distrust and suspicion, the rule book
grows in size because everything has to be documented. Disputes are always
bubbling, and there are likely to be complaints of harassment and discrimination.
</P>

<P>It is interesting to note that at the same time as there is a Government
policy of imposing competition between firms, there is a recognition that
the best working teams are based on co-operation.. </P>

<P>Indeed competition would seem to militate against the levels of trust
and co-operation that are emerging in studies of best practice. We need
consider whether the loss of social capital through workplace competition
may also prove in the not-so-long-run to reduce productivity and profits.
</P>

<P>What are the elements of social systems which increase social capital?
They are mainly based on interactions. They involve space, time, opportunities,
precedent and the valuing of process. </P>

<P>We need the opportunities to interact with a reasonably broad spread
of people, and to build up a level of trust through positive rather than
negative experiences. We need the time to engage in satisfactory processes
of discussion, to acknowledge the input of others, and to develop outcomes
which reflect their inputs. </P>

<P>Public life and activities take time, and time is an ever decreasing
'commodity' for many people. Full time work often extends well past the
eight hour day, yet time is available in excess to those who have no paid
work. This is one of the dis-eases of our present community. There is a
constant trade off between time and money. </P>

<P>If we decide to value all aspects of the vita activa, we should be able
to spend time in paid work earning money, using our skills and contributing
to the workplace community. </P>

<P>We should also be able to spend time on interpersonal relationships
and the daily tasks of care for self and others, including the rearing
of children. </P>

<P>And we should also be able to spend time in the public sphere producing
ideas, running small communal groups or large institutions and involving
ourselves in making decisions that affect the way we live, and even involved
in our own government or the big institutions. </P>

<P>We must validate the social, and re-member that humans were never disconnected
individuals. We have always been social. Our human ability to reason has
never removed us from our interdependence. In fact, it is through our ability
to co-operate, as well as compete, that we have developed what passes for
civilisation. </P>

<P>I want to reclaim the concept of civic virtue as a collective rather
than an individual manifestation of a truly civil society. The types of
civic structures which develop social capital are not created by removing
the underpinnings of the state, but by giving people time, skills, encouragement
and resources. </P>

<P>What happens when we run down our social capital? This raises the issue
of whether we live in communities or nations which offer sufficient possibilities
for experiencing social trust. Are there societies with an adequate level
of social capital? Is there a social plimsoll line, a marker which once
passed, reduces the levels of civic virtue to the point of no return? </P>

<P>If our communities are already low in social capital, or maybe even
in deficit, their re-construction will be slow. Putnam talks of the problems
of countries where communism wiped out much of the civic culture or the
others where centuries of top down feudalism was never been replaced by
any form of democratic structure.The process of replenishing or developing
social capital takes a long time. The Italian examples Putnam quotes are
the results of centuries of civic cultures. Losing social capital should
therefore be identified as a serious problem. The question Putnam asks
of the USA, and that I am raising here, is: are we running our social capital
down and even out?We have a different political culture from the United
States of America. The American colonies had a much stronger emphasis on
free enterprose and individualism than on Government. Our colonies were
started by Government fiat and we continue to have a closer relationship
to the public sector than our American peers. Trust in government I suspect,
is one of our social capital indicators. </P>

<P>In Australia, opinion polls over time suggest there is increasing cynicism
about Government and politicians. There are diminished levels of trust
in public utilities, particularly when they corporatise and treat us as
customers not citizens. These days, our utilities delivering phones, gas,
water and electricity behave just like any other big business. Yet when
they are sold, the public feels a loss of common property. </P>

<P>I have a strong sense that we are unravelling and tearing the social
fabric, replacing it with a safety net that catches some of the poor and
leaves the rest of us to flounder. We are losing some of the sense of belonging,
of the common wealth that is part of our public selves. We are left to
retreat into the presumed safety of the private world. </P>

<P>We need to recognise that a loss of social capital may cost us dearly.
For instance, an increased fear of crime, when the crime rate is not rising,
is a more significant measure of social distrust than an actual increase
in crime. The unreasoned fear of other people's criminal intent signals
a major decline in social capital. </P>

<P>It is this unwarranted fear that leads to the demand for more Government
spending on crime prevention measures, gaols and other forms of social
control. The last New South Wales state election was a case in point, when
the then Government and Opposition tried to out do each other in their
promises to punish criminals. Yet there was no real evidence that crime
was on the increase, nor that the proposed measures would curb it. </P>

<P>Expenditure in this area was seen as politically necessary but was unlikely
to be effective because it failed to address the real problem. In fact
more law and order measures would probably exacerbate the problem because
they would lift the levels of anxiety but do nothing to reduce the level
of crime. </P>

<P>It is an interesting contradiction that increased rates of imprisonment
and policing under conservative governments leads to the higher spending
they claim to be against. And expenditure on social control often exceeds
the cost of those government services which increase social capital - for
instance more jobs in the community services sector. It is obviously a
waste of money in more ways than one. </P>

<P>We are left with the contradiction that a government's failure to spend
on enhancing social capital, will actually reduce the level of financial
capital. Indeed, high social capital may well be the prerequisite for economic
growth, not the other way round.This week, I've looked at community and
social capital, but next week I want to look at the other side, the dark
side of community and family - the tribalism that can break down social
capital. </P>
