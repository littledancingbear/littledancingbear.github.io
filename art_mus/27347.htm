<b>Commerce over communication - the fight against rock lyrics</b>
</font>
<br>
October 1999

<p>
You know how it is when you sing with the song and suddenly you don't know what the next line is. Lyrics of rock-songs are sometimes essential for appreciating the song, and sometimes they are essential to let your lover know how you feel.

<p>
I don't believe that rock-musicians have anything against the display of the lyrics on the WWW. I can't imagine that they're money-greedy as their managers and publishing companies which have an interest to make money just because you want to know that next line.

<p>
The International Lyric Server was a labor of love project by a Swiss guy and the community which submitted lyrics. Now, the server's been shut down ... and it re-emerged as a sub-division of some US company which claims to represent the musicians.

<p>
No relevant lyrics are available anymore and the web-site has an appalling design and structure. Not much is working at all.

<p>
I'm angry about this "development", as it only alienates us from the music we love. This US company certainly has no support from my side and I can only say: Shame on you!! 

<p>
Rock music is public domain even though the artists and record companies earn a lot of money from it.

<p>
Give us back the lyrics ...
