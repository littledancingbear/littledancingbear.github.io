<P>The dialectic cannot stop short before the concepts of health and sickness,
nor indeed before their siblings reason and unreason. <BR>
Adorno, Theodor W. (1974), Minima moralia. Reflections from damaged life.
(First published in German 1951.) London (NLB), 73<BR>
</P>

<P>Exuberant health is always, as such, sickness also.<BR>
Adorno, Theodor W. (1974), Minima moralia. Reflections from damaged life.
(First published in German 1951.) London (NLB), 77<BR>
</P>

<P>The very people who burst with proofs of exuberant vitality could easily
be taken for prepared corpses, from whom the news of their not-quite-successful
decease has been withheld for reasons of population policy. Underlying
the prevalent health is death. All the movements of health resemble the
reflex-movements of beings whose hearts have stopped beating.<BR>
Adorno, Theodor W. (1974), Minima moralia. Reflections from damaged life.
(First published in German 1951.) London (NLB), 59<BR>
</P>

<P>And how comfortless is the thought that the sickness of the normal does
not necessarily imply as its opposite the health of the sick, but that
the latter usually only present, in a different way, the same disastrous
pattern.<BR>
Adorno, Theodor W. (1974), Minima moralia. Reflections from damaged life.
(First published in German 1951.) London (NLB), 60<BR>
</P>

<P>Substantial proportions of the population did not see health as the
most important thing in life - and these were more likely to be people
with more, rather than less, education.<BR>
Blaxter, Mildred, Health and lifestyles. London (Routledge), 1990, 241<BR>
</P>

<P>Health is not, in the minds of most people, a unitary concept. It is
multi-dimensional, and it is quite possible to have 'good' health in one
respect, but 'bad' in another.<BR>
Blaxter, Mildred, Health and lifestyles. London (Routledge), 1990, 35<BR>
</P>

<P>Health can be defined negatively, as the absence of illness, functionally,
as the ability to cope with everyday activities, or positively, as fitness
and well-being. It has also been noted that in the modern world, health
still has a moral dimension.<BR>
Blaxter, Mildred, Health and lifestyles. London (Routledge), 1990, 14</P>

<P>What is a health which merely makes people ripe to be damaged, abused,
and shot at again?<BR>
Bloch, Ernst (1995), The principle of hope. Cambridge, Mass. (MIT Press),
470<BR>
</P>

<P>[H]ealth is something which should be enjoyed, not abused. A long painless
life to a ripe old age, culminating in a death replete with life, is still
outstanding, has constantly been planned. As if newborn: this is what the
outlines of a better world suggest as far as the body is concerned. But
people cannot walk upright if social life itself still lies crooked.<BR>
Bloch, Ernst (1995), The principle of hope. Cambridge, Mass. (MIT Press),
471<BR>
</P>

<P>[H]ealth is a wavering notion, if not directly in medical terms, then
in social terms. Health is by no means solely a medical notion, but predominantly
a societal one. Restoring to health again means in reality bringing the
sick man to that kind of health which is respectively acknowledged in each
respective society, and which was in fact first formed in that society
itself.<BR>
Bloch, Ernst (1995), The principle of hope. Cambridge, Mass. (MIT Press),
465<BR>
</P>

<P>If the exploited lives to which so many are returned were worth something,
and if a war did not make up in days for years of lost death, then doctors
could be half content with the course of the last hundred years.<BR>
Bloch, Ernst (1995), The principle of hope. Cambridge, Mass. (MIT Press),
456<BR>
</P>

<P>In capitalist society health is the capability to earn, among the Greeks
it was the capability to enjoy, and in the Middle Ages the capability to
believe.<BR>
Bloch, Ernst (1995), The principle of hope. Cambridge, Mass. (MIT Press),
465<BR>
</P>

<P>So hardly any of the ills of the body are removed when it is seen in
isolation. That is why all improvers of our situation who merely concentrate
on health are so petit-bourgeois and odd, the raw fruit and vegetable brigade,
the passionate herbivores, or even those who practise special breathing
techniques. All this is a mockery compared with solid misery, compared
with diseases which are produced not by weak flesh but by powerful hunger,
not by faulty breathing but by dust, smoke, and lead. Of course there are
people who breathe correctly, who combine a pleasant self-assurance with
well-ventilated lungs and an upright torso which is flexible to a ripe
old age. But it remains a prerequisite that these people have money; which
is more beneficial for a stooped posture than the art of breathing.<BR>
Bloch, Ernst (1995), The principle of hope. Cambridge, Mass. (MIT Press),
467<BR>
</P>

<P>All in all, even without grotesque visions, every organic desire for
improvement remains up in the air if the social one is not acknowledged
and taken into account. Health is a social concept, exactly like the organic
existence in general of human beings, as human beings. Thus it can only
be meaningfully increased at all if life in which it stands is not itself
overcrowded with anxiety, deprivation and death.<BR>
Bloch, Ernst (1995), The principle of hope. Cambridge, Mass. (MIT Press),
467<BR>
</P>

<P>... health, which is undoubtedly the chief good and the foundation of
all the other goods in this life. For even the mind depends so much on
the temperament and disposition of the bodily organs that if it is possible
to find some means of making men in general wiser and more skilful than
they have been up till now, I believe we must look for it in medicine.
It is true that medicine as currently practised does not contain much of
any significant use; but without intending to disparage it, I am sure there
is no one, even among its practicioners, who would not admit that all we
know in medicine is almost nothing in comparison with what remains to be
known, and that we might free ourselves from innumerable diseases, both
of the body and of the mind, and perhaps even from the informity of old
age, if we had sufficient knowledge of their causes and of all the remedies
that nature has provided.<BR>
Descartes, Selected philosophical writings. Cambridge (Cambridge University
Press), 1988, 47<BR>
</P>

<P>It is a disturbing fact that Western civilization, which claims to have
achieved the highest standard of health in history, finds itself compelled
to spend ever-increasing sums for the control of disease.<BR>
Dubos, Ren&eacute;, Mirage of Health. Utopias, progress, and biological
change. New Brunswick (Rutgers University Press), 1987, here: 215<BR>
</P>

<P>Clearly, health and disease cannot be defined merely in terms of anatomical,
physiological, or mental attributes. Their real measure is the ability
of the individual to function in a manner acceptable to himself and to
the group of which he is a part. <BR>
Dubos, Ren&eacute;, Mirage of Health. Utopias, progress, and biological
change. New Brunswick (Rutgers University Press), 1987, here: 261<BR>
</P>

<P>One may wonder indeed whether the pretense of superior health is not
itself rapidly becoming a mental aberration.<BR>
Dubos, Ren&eacute;, Mirage of health. Utopias, progress, and biological
change. New Brunswick (Rutgers University Press), 1987, here: 25<BR>
</P>

<P>Money has, as we know, no value in itself. It is a convenient yardstick
for a large number of material values. But the health and life of an individual
as well as the health of a nation cannot be measured by that yardstick.
If we, entrusted with protecting and defending the health of the population,
give in to a salesman's scale of values we are lost.<BR>
Evang, Karl, Health service, society, and medicine. Present day health
services in their relation to medical science and social structures. London
(Oxford University Press), 1960, 18-19<BR>
</P>

<P>To state that the cost of proper medical care itself surpasses the financial
resources of any of the countries in the West is of course ridiculous,
not the least when one considers the other purposes for which money is
freely being used and working hours spent.<BR>
Evang, Karl, Health service, society, and medicine. Present day health
services in their relation to medical science and social structures. London
(Oxford University Press), 1960, 19<BR>
</P>

<P>It wasn't a healthy attitude, but it wasn't really a healthy world.
<BR>
Friedman, Kinky (1993), A case of Lone Star. New York (Wings Books), 391<BR>
</P>

<P>He looked a shade too healthy and nobody likes that. Particularly in
New York.<BR>
Friedman, Kinky (1993), Greenwich Killing Time. New York (Wings Books),
42<BR>
</P>

<P>The main health hazard in the world today is people who don't love themselves.<BR>
Friedman, Kinky (1993), When the cat's away. New York (Wings Books), 531<BR>
</P>

<P>The sustaining of life, in a bodily sense as well as in the sense of
psychological health, is inherently subject to risk.<BR>
Giddens, Anthony (1991), Modernity and self-identity. Self and society
in the late modern age. Cambridge (Polity Press), 40<BR>
</P>

<P>The human body contains blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. These
are the things that make up its constitution and cause its pain and health.
Health is primarily that state in which these constituent substances are
in the correct proportion to each other, both in strength and quantity,
and are well mixed.<BR>
Hippocrates, Hippocratic writings. Edited with an introduction by G.E.R.
Lloyd. Harmondsworth (Penguin), 1978, 262<BR>
</P>

<P>A wise man ought to realize that health is his most valuable possession
and learn how to treat his illnesses by his own judgement.<BR>
Hippocrates, Hippocratic writings. Edited with an introduction by G.E.R.
Lloyd. Harmondsworth (Penguin), 1978, 276<BR>
</P>

<P>Instead of changing our mechanistic workplaces to make them safer and
more conducive to the human body, we can screen, monitor, or change the
bodies of workers so that they better fit the modern workplace.<BR>
Our association of the body with &quot;efficient machines&quot; has crept
into our culture in ways other than work. It has created a modern body
type in the machine's image - what one commentator has called &quot;techno-body&quot;.
The techno-body ideal, for men, and increasingly for women, is the &quot;lean,
mean machine&quot;: a hairless, overly muscled body, occasionally oiled,
which very much resembles a machine. For many body zealots, the healthy
body is one that functions and looks like an &quot;efficient machine&quot;,
not a body that is functioning in a natural and holistic fashion. <BR>
Kimbrell, Andrew (1993), The human body shop. The engineering and marketing
of life. San Francisco (HarperCollins), 249<BR>
</P>

<P>Maxim 193:<BR>
The sicknesses of the soul have their ups and downs like those of the body;
what we take to be a cure is most often merely a respite or change of disease.<BR>
La Rochefoucauld (1959), Maxims. Translated with an introduction by Leonard
Tancock. London (Penguin), hier: 61<BR>
</P>

<P>Maxim 44:<BR>
Strength and weakness of mind are misnomers; they are really nothing but
the good or bad health of our bodily organs.<BR>
La Rochefoucauld (1959), Maxims. Translated with an introduction by Leonard
Tancock. London (Penguin), hier: 42<BR>
</P>

<P>Maxim 188:<BR>
Spiritual health is no more stable than bodily; and though we may seem
unaffected by the passions we are just as liable to be carried away by
them as to fall ill when in good health.<BR>
La Rochefoucauld (1959), Maxims. Translated with an introduction by Leonard
Tancock. London (Penguin), hier: 61<BR>
</P>

<P>Maxime 593:<BR>
Sobriety is concern for one's health - or limited capacity.<BR>
La Rochefoucauld (1959), Maxims. Translated with an introduction by Leonard
Tancock. London (Penguin), hier: 118<BR>
</P>

<P>Maxim 633:<BR>
To safeguard one's health at the cost of too strict a diet is a tiresome
illness indeed.<BR>
La Rochefoucauld (1959), Maxims. Translated with an introduction by Leonard
Tancock. London (Penguin), hier: 124<BR>
</P>

<P>Maxim 541:<BR>
Wisdom is to the soul what health is to the body.<BR>
La Rochefoucauld (1959), Maxims. Translated with an introduction by Leonard
Tancock. London (Penguin), hier: 108<BR>
</P>

<P>Maxim 542:<BR>
As the great ones of this world are unable to bestow health of body or
peace of mind, we always pay too high a price for any good they can do.<BR>
La Rochefoucauld (1959), Maxims. Translated with an introduction by Leonard
Tancock. London (Penguin), hier: 109<BR>
</P>

<P>Good health has become a new ritual of patriotism, a market place for
the public display of secular faith in the power of will. <BR>
Levin, Roger, Cancer and the self: How illness constellates meaning. In:
Levin, D.M. (ed.), Pathologies of the modern self. Postmodern studies on
narcissism, schizophrenia, and depression. New York/London (New York University

<BR>
</P>

<P>Low income is related to poorer housing, poorer diet, fewer social amenities,
worse working conditions. (...) After adjustment for age, sex, race, smoking,
alcohol consumption, sleep habits, leisure-time physical activity, chest
pain, diabetes, or cancer, there was still an increase risk of 1.6 for
those with inadequate incomes. <BR>

</P>

<P>... social environment in childhood affects achieved adult height, life
chances, and ultimately mortality rates in adult life. (...) <BR>
... social circumstances acting in childhood do have a persisting effect
on adult disease rates, in addition to influences acting in adulthood.<BR>

and disease. In: Annual Review of Public Health 1987, Vol. 8, 111-135,
here: 128<BR>
</P>

<P>The social forces affecting health are expressed in class structure.
This division into classes encompasses economic, political, and cultural
differences, all of which may have an impact on health. At the very least,
differences in health and disease by social class point to the importance
of the social environment. Within medicine, the tradition is to focus on
individuals: individual differences in biological makeup, in disease, in
lifestyle, and in choices about health. The implication is that such disease
that is not genetically determined is determined by individual exposure.
While this supposition is not necessarily incorrect, it is incomplete.<BR>

and disease. In: Annual Review of Public Health 1987, Vol. 8, 111-135,

</P>

<P>General improvements in health/decline in mortality do not affect all
classes equally. As mortality rates fall, social inequalities commonly
widen.<BR>

</P>

<P>Something is happening to America, not something dangerous but something
all too safe. I see it in my lifelong friends. I am a child of the &quot;baby
boom&quot;, a generation not known for its sane or cautious approach to
things. Yet suddenly my peers are giving up drinking, giving up smoking,
cutting down on coffee, sugar, and salt. They will not eat red meat and
go now to restaurants whose menus have caused me to stand on a chair yelling,
&quot;Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, dinner is served!&quot; This from the
generation of LSD, Weather Underground, and Altamont Rock Festival! And
all in the name of safety! Our nation has withstood many divisions - North
and South, black and white, labor and management - but I do not know if
the country can survive division into smoking and non-smoking sections.<BR>
O'Rourke, P.J. (1987), Republican Party Reptile. The confessions, adventures,
essays and other outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 40<BR>
</P>

<P>The forces of safety are afoot in the land. I, for one, believe it is
a conspiracy - a conspiracy of Safety Nazis shouting &quot;Sieg Health&quot;
and seeking to trammel freedom, liberty, and large noisy parties. The Safety
Nazis advocate gun control, vigorous exercise, and health foods. The result
can only be a disarmed, exhausted, and half-starved population ready to
acquiesce to dictatorship of some kind.<BR>

essays and other outrages of P.J. O'Rourke. London (Picador), 41-42<BR>

<P>Sanity is not truth. Sanity is conformity to what is socially expected.
Truth is sometimes in conformity, sometimes not.<BR>
Pirsig, Robert M., Lila. An inquiry into morals. New York (Bantam Books)
1991, 335<BR>
</P>

<P>... the idea of a sharp distinction between health and disease is a
medical artefact for which nature, if consulted, provides no support.<BR>
Rose, Geoffrey, The strategy of preventive medicine. Oxford (Oxford University
Press), 1992, here: 6<BR>
</P>

<P>The essential determinants of the health of society are thus to be found
in its mass characteristics: the deviant minority can only be understood
when seen in its societal context, and effective prevention requires changes
which involve the population as a whole.<BR>
Rose, Geoffrey, The strategy of preventive medicine. Oxford (Oxford University
Press), 1992, here: vii<BR>
</P>

<P>Social norms rigidly constrain how we live, and individuals who transgress
the limits can expect trouble. We may think that our personal life-style
represents our own free choice, but that belief is often mistaken. It is
hard to be a non-smoker in a smoking milieu, or vice versa, and it may
be impossible to eat very differently from one's family and associates.
Social norms set rigid limits on diversity, and those wishing to persuade
minorities to be different from the majority would do well to remember
the rooks.<BR>
Rose, Geoffrey, The strategy of preventive medicine. Oxford (Oxford University
Press), 1992, here: 56<BR>
</P>

<P>In a democracy the ultimate responsibility for decisions on health policy
should lie with the public. At present that does not happen. <BR>
Rose, Geoffrey, The strategy of preventive medicine. Oxford (Oxford University
Press), 1992, here: 124<BR>
</P>

<P>For 'wellness', naturally, is no cause for complaint - people relish
it, they enjoy it, they are at the furthest pole from complaint. People
complain of feeling ill - not well ... Thus, though a patient will scarcely
complain of being 'very well', they may become suspicious if they feel
'too well'.<BR>
Sacks, Oliver, The man who mistook his wife for a hat. London (Picador)
1986, 84<BR>
</P>

<P>Enhancement not only allows the possibilities of a healthy fullness
and exuberance, but of a rather ominous extravagance, aberration, monstrosity
... This danger is built into the very nature of growth and life. Growth
can become over-growth, life 'hyper-life' ... The paradox of an illness
which can present as wellness - as a wonderful feeling of health and well-being,
and only later reveal its malignant potentials - is one of the chimaeras,
tricks and ironies of nature.<BR>
Sacks, Oliver, The man who mistook his wife for a hat. London (Picador)
1986, 83<BR>
</P>

<P>Of course, everyone wants to be healthy. The amusing thing is no one's
really sure how to do it.<BR>
Seinfeld, Jerry (1995), SeinLanguage. New York (Bantam Books), 36<BR>
</P>

<P>Our tradition in this country has not been to deny health information
to interested individuals when they claim that they can handle it and are
willing to pay for the cost of getting it.<BR>
Shapiro, Robert, The human blueprint. The race to unlock the secrets of
our genetic code. New York (Bantam Books), 1992, 158<BR>
</P>

<P>Science becomes a propaganda of quack cures, manufactured by companies
in which the rich hold shares, for the diseases of the poor who need only
better food and sanitary houses, and of the rich who need only useful occupation,
to keep them both in health.<BR>
Shaw, Bernard, The intelligent woman's guide to socialism, capitalism,
sovietism &amp; fascism. Harmondsworth (Penguin), 1982, 95<BR>
</P>

<P>Where once it was the physician who waged <I>bellum contra morbum</I>,
the war against disease, now it's the whole society.<BR>
Sontag, Susan (1989), AIDS and its metaphor. London (Penguin), 10<BR>
</P>

<P>[M]ilitary metaphors have more and more come to infuse all aspects of
the description of the medical situation. Disease is seen as an invasion
of alien organisms, to which the body responds by its own military operations,
such as the mobilizing of immunological &quot;defenses&quot;, and medicine
is &quot;aggressive&quot; as in the language of most chemotherapies.<BR>
Sontag, Susan (1989), AIDS and its metaphor. London (Penguin), 9<BR>
</P>

<P>The only ideals allowed are healthy ones - those everyone may aspire
to, or comfortably imagine oneself possessing.<BR>
Sontag, Susan (1993), The volcano lover. A romance. London (Vintage Books),
197<BR>
</P>

<P>Health hype is like any other kind of hype. It exaggerates. It overstates
the case. Whatever the facts may be, health hype feels compelled to magnify
them. (6)<BR>

Taylor, Robert L. (1990), Health fact, health fiction. Getting through

</P>

<P>... class differences in health represent a double injustice: life is
short where its quality is poor.<BR>
Wilkinson, Richard G., Socio-economic differences in mortality: interpreting
the data on their size and trends. In: Wilkinson, Richard G. (ed.), Class
and health. Research and longitudinal data. London (Tavistock), 1986, 1-20,

</P>

<P>Improved health contributes to economic growth in four ways: it reduces
production losses caused by worker illness; it permits the use of natural
resources that had been totally or nearly inaccessible because of disease;
it increases the enrollment of children in school and makes them better
able to learn; and it frees for alternative uses resources that would otherwise
have to be spent on treating illness.<BR>
World Bank (1993), World development report 1993. New York (Oxford University
Press), 17<BR>
</P>

<P>World health spending - and thus also the potential for misallocation,
waste, and inequitable distribution of resources - is huge. For the world
as a whole in 1990, public and private expenditure on health services was
about $1,700 billion, or 8 percent of total world product. High-income
countries spent almost 90 percent of this amount, for an average of $1,500
per person. The United States alone consumed 41 percent of the global total
- more than 12 percent of its gross national product (GNP). Developing
countries spent about $170 billion, or 4 percent of their GNP, for an average
of $41 per person - less than on-thirtieth the amount spent by rich countries.<BR>
World Bank (1993), World development report 1993. New York (Oxford University
Press), 4<BR>
</P>

<P>Serious environmental health problems are shared by both developed and
developing countries, affecting:<BR>
- hundreds of millions of people who suffer from respiratory and other
diseases caused or exacerbated by biological and chemical agents, including
tobacco smoke, in the air, both indoors and outdoors;<BR>
- hundreds of millions who are exposed to unnecessary chemical and physical
hazards in their home, workplace, or wider environment (including 500.000
who die and tens of millions more who are injured in road accidents each
year).<BR>
Health also depends on whether people can obtain food, water, and shelter.
Over 100 million people lack the income or land to meet such basic needs.
Hundreds of million suffer from undernutrition. <BR>

on Health and Environment. Geneva (WHO), 1992, XIII<BR>
</P>

<P>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.<BR>
The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the
fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion,
political belief, economic or social condition. <BR>
