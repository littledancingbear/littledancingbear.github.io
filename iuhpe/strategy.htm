The International Union for Health Promotion and Education is nearly half a century old, and draws its strength from being a unique worldwide association of individuals and organisations committed to improving the health of the people of the world through education, community action and the development of healthy public policies.

<P>
Through periods of major change in the external environment and within the field of health education and health promotion, the organisation has proven to be relevant and resilient. It has flourished as the only global, non-governmental organization of practitioners in this field, and cooperates closely with <A HREF="http://www.who.int/">WHO</A>, <A HREF="http://www.unesco.org/">UNESCO</A>, <A HREF="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</A>, other major intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations to influence and facilitate the <A HREF="http://www.ldb.org/vl/top/top-hpr.htm">development of health promotion strategies and projects</A>.

<P>
It is an open and inviting organization, providing an opportunity to build an international network that encourages the free exchange of ideas, knowledge, and experiences, as well as facilitating the development of relevant collaborative projects at global and regional levels.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Our Changing World</FONT></B>

<P>
The prerequisites for health - peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity - remain unchallenged. Their presence or absence continues to define the reasons why some of the world's people are healthy and others are not. It is vital therefore, that the IUHPE as an organisation overtly accounts for the political, economic, social, and physical environment in which it operates.

<P>
As world's poorer nations strive to achieve economic, social and political development there are many contradictions. In some countries, growing wealth has eased the lives and improved the health of many people, although it is often being achieved at the expense of the physical environment and has created injust social and economic inequities among people.

<P>
Most countries in the world are going through a restructuring process in efforts to respond to the pressures of a rapidly globalised economy.  In many countries, this involves a decreasing role for governments in solving problems. Even in the richest countries, social investments by governments are being eroded - including publically funded health services. The resulting social and economic insecurity is rapidly translated into increased inequity in health between rich and poor within all countries. There is little question that a growing number of people have less and less opportunity "to make healthy choices"

<P>
Thus, the overriding global concern for the IUHPE is the impact on health of growing disparities between the rich and the poor, and the need to identify new partners and new ways of working to respond to these challenges.

<P>
This rapidly changing global political, economic, and social environments within which the IUHPE is operating require the organisation to regularly review its strategic direction and its capacity to serve the needs of its members. The updated strategic directions outlined in this paper revisits the IUHPE 's mission, goals, objectives, and priorities for action, and is intended to provide a clear sense of direction and purpose for the organisation for the six years 1999-2004.

<P>
<B>Challenges</B>

<P>
<B>The IUHPE, as a global organisation, has to respond to these global realities positively, recognising:</B>

<P>
<B>The IUHPE can make a difference to global health</B>

<P>
We must build on our considerable strengths to play a meaningful role in the world arena. The organisation's  major strength lies in the quality of the skills and knowledge of the membership, and the capabilities of the Headquarters and <A HREF="address.htm">Regional Offices</A> in securing partnerships and resources to enable the organisation to pursue its goals. The IUHPE needs to unlock this potential by enlarging and involving its membership. The regional offices have a central role in achieving the overall global strategy.

<P>
<B>The work of the IUHPE is more important than ever</B>

<P>
As governments retreat from a direct role in actions to promote and protect the health of their citizens, the role played by <A HREF="http://www.ldb.org/top/top-ngo.htm">non-government organisations</A> becomes increasingly important. Small non government organisations such as the IUHPE work most effectively through partnerships. The IUHPE has the commitment and people to play a leadership role in health promotion in collaboration with existing and new partners. We have to break through traditional barriers between public and private, government and non-government sectors in pursuit of our health promotion goals. 

<P>
<B>The IUHPE cannot do everything at once</B>

<P>
We must make hard decisions about priorities, and invest our limited resources in pursuing strategic directions that address our priority goals and objectives. This includes the need to strengthen the Organisation.

<P>
<B>These Strategic Directions will provide focus and direction for activity by the membership, the <A HREF="address.htm">Regional Offices and the Headquarters</A>.</B>

<P> 
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>The IUHPE will implement its strategies - advocacy, professional and technical development, networking, partnership building, and strengthening the organisation - by undertaking the following proposed priorities for action:</FONT></B>

<OL>
<LI> 
Publish Journal

<P>
<LI>
Organise conferences and meetings

<P>
<LI>
Develop and sustain networks

<P>

</OL>

These will form the basis of the IUHPE Work Plan for the next three years (1999-2001)

<P> 
<B>Publish Journal</B>

<P>
The quarterly Journal <A HREF="journal.htm">Promotion & Education</A> communicates, and promotes the dissemination of, information about current practice in promoting health in a range of settings, addressing a range of health issues, or the health of specific populations ; about effective practice in promoting health ; and about building individuals', communities' , countries' and international capacity to promote the health of populations.

<P>
The Journal is widely regarded as one of the organisation's most effective contributions to the practice of health promotion across the world. It is also the official vehicle for communication within the IUHPE and about the IUHPE. It reaches all members four times a year and is an essential tool of communication with global membership and with external organisations.

<P>
<B>Organise conferences and meetings</B>

<P>
<A HREF="17wc.htm">IUHPE's World</A> and Regional conferences promote discussion about and dissemination of effective practice in health promotion and health education across the world, with particular emphasis on improving the quality and effectiveness of practice designed to reduce inequalities in health ; they enhance the international network of practitioners who promote health across the world ; and they contribute to the body of knowledge that underpins health promotion.

<P>
They offer the opportunity to prepare and endorse policies that can form the basis for advocacy by the organisation, and for the furthering of the Global Network. 

<P>
Through a series of international seminars and workshops the organisation will contribute to the development of the knowledge base for, and obtain international consensus on key issues such as:

<UL>
<LI>
role of governments in promoting health
<LI>
role of the private sector in promoting health
<LI>
role of NGOs in promoting health
<LI>
role of intergovernmental organisations in promoting health

measures of success in health promotion - what constitutes success, and how should/can it be measured?
<LI>
measurement of progress toward health for all.
</LI>
</UL>

Through its conferences and seminars the IUHPE will also offer opportunities for training on key issues such as advocacy, development and implementation of healthy public policy, reproductive health, electronic communication, building effective partnerships, etc.

<P>
<B>Develop and sustain networks</B>

<P>
The global network development sessions conducted at the World and Regional Conferences together with the increased use of electronic communication (listserv, webpages) to encourage active communication among members is considered to be a vital step to increase the dissemination of information about and within the IUHPE ; and to.communicate information on effective practice among health professionals, to inform them and to mobilise them for action, when necessary.

<P>
<B>Manage projects which are compatible with priority goals and objectives</B>

<P>
The IUHPE will seek to build strong partnership through international projects and events, with organisations that share the same aims and objectives.Through such partnership, the IUHPE helps to build and contributes to alliances among many different organizations in the public, voluntary, and private sectors.

<P>
<B>Prepare position statements</B>

<P>
on effective health promotion practice, training standards and infrastructure development with recommendations for action by governments, and organisations (including private sector organisations). This will include the appropriate allocation of resources to promote the health of the populations in addition to investment in health care services.

<P>
The IUHPE will assist in the development of standards of competence for the health promotion workforces in different parts of the world, working with different population groups in different settings.
