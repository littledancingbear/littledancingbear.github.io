Health Promotion into the 21st Century</FONT></B>

<P>Background:</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 4th International conference on Health Promotion
- <I>New Players for a New Era: Leading Health Promotion into the 21st
Century</I> - comes at a critical moment in the development of international
strategies for health. It is almost 20 years after the World Health Organisation
member states made an ambitious commitment to a global strategy of <I>Health
for All</I>, and to the principles of primary health care through the <I>Alma-Ata
Declaration</I>. It is ten years after the 1st International Conference
on Health Promotion was held in Ottawa, Canada. That conference resulted
in publication of the <I>Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion</I> which
has been a source of guidance and inspiration for health promotion since
that time. Subsequent international conferences and meetings have further
clarified the relevance and meaning of key strategies in health promotion
including healthy public policy (In Adelaide, 1988), and supportive environments
for health (in Sundsvall, 1991). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The 4th International Conference on Health promotion
in Jakarta is the first to be held in a developing country, and the first
to involve the private sector in supporting health promotion. It provides
an opportunity to reflect on what has been learned about effective health
promotion, to re-examine determinants of health, and to identify the directions
and strategies which are required to address the challenges of promoting
health in the 21st Century.</FONT></P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Health promotion is a valuable investment</FONT></P>

<P>Health is a basic human right and essential for social and economic
development. </P>

<P>Increasingly, health promotion is being recognised as an essential
element of health development. It is a process of enabling people to increase
control over and to improve their health. Health promotion, through investments
and actions, acts on the determinants of health to create the greatest
health gain for people, to contribute significantly to the reduction of
inequities in health, to ensure human rights, and to build social capital.
The ultimate goal is to increase health expectancy, and to narrow the gap
in health expectancy between countries and groups. </P>

<P>The Jakarta Declaration on health promotion offers a vision and focus
for health promotion into the next century. It reflects the firm commitment
of participants at the 4th International Conference on Health Promotion
to draw upon the widest range of resources to tackle health determinants
in the 21st century.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Determinants of health: new challenges</FONT></P>

<P>Pre-requisites for health are peace, shelter, education, social security,
social relations, food, income, empowerment of women, a stable eco-system,
sustainable resource use, social justice, respect for human rights and
equity. Above all, poverty is the greatest threat to health. </P>

<P>Demographic trends such as urbanisation, an increase in the number of older people and the prevalence of chronic diseases pose new problems in all countries. Other social, behavioural and biological changes such as increased sedentary behaviour, resistance to antibiotics and other commonly available drugs, increased drug abuse and civil and domestic violence, threaten the health and well-being of hundreds of millions of people.</P>

<P>New and re-emerging infectious diseases, and greater recognition
of mental health problems require an urgent response. It is vital that
health promotion evolve to meet changes in the determinants of health.
</P>

<P>Transnational factors also have a significant impact on health. These
include the integration of the global economy, financial markets and trade,
access to media and communication technology, as well as environmental
degradation due to the irresponsible use of resources. </P>

<P>These changes shape values, lifestyles throughout the lifespan, and
living conditions across the world. Some have great potential for health,
such as the development of communications technology, others such as international
trade in tobacco, have a major negative impact.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Health promotion makes a difference </FONT></P>

<P>Research and case studies from around the world provide convincing
evidence that health promotion works. Health promotion strategies can develop
and change lifestyles, and the social, economic and environmental conditions
which determine health. Health promotion is a practical approach to achieving
greater equity in health. </P>

<P>The five Ottawa Charter strategies are essential for success:</P>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>build healthy public policy</LI>

<LI>create supportive environments</LI>

<LI>strengthen community action</LI>

<LI>develop personal skills</LI>

<LI>re-orient health services.</LI>
</UL>

<P>There is now clear evidence that:</P>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>comprehensive approaches to health development are the most effective.
Those which use combinations of the five strategies are more effective
than single track approaches</LI>

<LI>settings offer practical opportunities for the implementation of
comprehensive strategies. These include mega-cities, islands, cities, municipalities,
and local communities, their markets, schools, workplace, and health care
facilities</LI>

<LI>participation is essential to sustain efforts. People have to be
at the centre of health promotion action and decision-making processes
for it to be effective</LI>

<LI>health learning fosters participation. Access to education and information
is essential to achieving effective participation and the empowerment of
people and communities</LI>
</UL>

<P>These strategies are core elements of health promotion and are relevant
for all countries.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>New responses are needed </FONT></P>

<P>To address emerging threats to health, new forms of action are needed.
The challenge for the coming years will be to unlock the potential for
health promotion inherent in many sectors of society, among local communities
and within families. </P>

<P>There is a clear need to break through traditional boundaries within
government sectors, between government and non-government organisations,
and between the public and private sector. Co-operation is essential. Specifically,
this requires the creation of new partnerships for health on equal ground
between the different sectors at all levels of governance in societies.
</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Priorities for Health Promotion in the 21st Century</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Promote social responsibility for health</FONT></I></P>

<P>Decision makers must be firmly committed to social responsibility.
Both the public and private sectors should promote health by pursuing policies
and practices that:</P>

<UL>
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>avoid harming the health of other individuals</LI>

<LI>protect the environment and ensure sustainable use of resources</LI>

<LI>restrict production and trade in inherently harmful goods and substances
such as tobacco and armaments, as well as unhealthy marketing practices</LI>

<LI>safeguard both the citizen in the marketplace and the individual
in the workplace</LI>

<LI>include equity-focussed health impact assessments as an integral
part of policy development</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Increase investments for health development</FONT></I></P>

<P>In many countries, current investment in health is inadequate and
often ineffective. Increasing investment for health development requires
a truly multi-sectoral approach, including additional resources to education,
housing as well as the health sector. Greater investment for health, and
re-orientation of existing investments - both within and between countries
- has the potential to significantly advance human development, health
and quality of life. </P>

<P>Investments in health should reflect the needs of certain groups
such as women, children, older people, indigenous, poor and marginalised
populations. </P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>3. Consolidate and expand partnerships for health</FONT></I></P>

<P>Health promotion requires partnerships for health and social development
between the different sectors at all levels of governance and society.
Existing partnerships need to be strengthened and the potential for new
partnerships must be explored. </P>

<P>Partnerships offer mutual benefit for health through the sharing
of expertise, skills, and resources. Each partnership must be transparent
and accountable and be based on agreed ethical principles, mutual understanding
and respect. WHO guidelines should be adhered to. </P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>4. Increase community capacity and empower the individual</FONT></I></P>

<P>Health promotion is carried out <I>by </I>and <I>with </I>people,
not on or to people. It improves both the ability of individuals to take
action, and the capacity of groups, organisations or communities to influence
the determinants of health.</P>

<P>Improving the capacity of communities for health promotion requires
practical education, leadership training, and access to resources. Empowering
individuals demands more consistent, reliable access to the decision making
process and the skills and knowledge essential to effect change. </P>

<P>Both traditional communication and the new information media support
this process. Social, cultural and spiritual resources need to be harnessed
in innovative ways.</P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>5. Secure an infrastructure for health promotion</FONT></I></P>

<P>To secure an infrastructure for health promotion, new mechanisms
of funding it locally, nationally and globally must be found. Incentives
should be developed to influence the actions of governments, nongovernmental
organizations, educational institutions and the private sector to make
sure that resource mobilization for health promotion is maximised.</P>

<P>&quot;Settings for health&quot; represent the organisational base
of the infrastructure required for health promotion. New health challenges
mean that new and diverse networks need to be created to achieve intersectoral
collaboration. Such networks should provide mutual assistance within and
between countries and facilitate exchange of information on which strategies
are effective in which settings. </P>

<P>Training and practice of local leadership skills should be encouraged
to support health promotion activities. Documentation of experiences in
health promotion through research and project reporting should be enhanced
to improve planning, implementation and evaluation.</P>

<P>All countries should develop the appropriate political, legal, educational,
social and economic environments required to support health promotion.</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Call for Action</FONT></P>

<P>Participants are committed to sharing the key messages of the Declaration
with their governments, institutions and communities, to put into practice
the actions proposed, and report back to the 5th International Conference
on Health Promotion.</P>

<P>In order to speed progress towards global health promotion, participants
endorse the formation of a global health promotion alliance. The goal of
this alliance is to advance the action priorities for health promotion
expressed in this declaration.</P>

<P>Priorities for the alliance include:</P>

<UL>
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>raising awareness about the changing determinants of health</LI>

<LI>supporting the development of collaboration and networks for health
development</LI>

<LI>mobilisation of resources for health promotion</LI>

<LI>accumulating knowledge on best practice</LI>

<LI>enabling shared learning</LI>

<LI>promoting solidarity in action</LI>

<LI>fostering transparency and public accoutability in health promotion</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>National governments are called to take initiative in fostering and
sponsoring networks for health promotion both within and between their
countries.</P>

<P>Participants in Jakarta ’97 called on WHO to take the lead in building
a global health promotion alliance and enabling its member states to implement
the results of the Jakarta Conference. A key part of this role is for WHO
to engage governments, nongovernmental organisations, development banks,
UN agencies, interregional bodies, bilateral agencies, the labour movement
and co-operatives, as well as the private sector in advancing the action
priorities for health promotion. </P>
