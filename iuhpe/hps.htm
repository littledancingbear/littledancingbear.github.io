 A "Health and Weight Awareness programme" was approved by the Cabinet, and as part of that programme, fitness instruction in the Nuku'alofa primary schools has been initiated by the Central Planning Department and the Ministry of Education.  The programme includes fitness instruction in the Nuku'alofa schools and TV promotion, aerobics competition, and development and distribution of education materials.
