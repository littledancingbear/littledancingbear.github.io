"Tuberculosis Treatment for All" Declaration
</b>
<br>
On 24 March 2000, World Tuberculosis Day, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) launched a campaign for TB treatment for all that is: free, adequate and uninterrupted, accessible, and administered by trained health workers. IUHPE's Executive Director Marie-Claude Lamarre has signed the declaration herself and urges others to do the same.
