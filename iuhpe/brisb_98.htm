<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues and friends,

<P>
it is a pleasure for me to be with you today, and to share with you strategies for the development of <A HREF="http://www.ldb.org/vl/top/top-hsch.htm">health-promoting schools</A> as they have developed in the different Regions of WHO.  

<P>
I wish to thank the organizers for inviting me to this conference. And I also wish to thank the traditional owners of this land for allowing us to share our experiences and ideas on their land.

<P>
This morning Jack Jones introduced to you the <A HREF="http://www.who.int/hpr/gshi/index.html">Global School Health Initiative of WHO</A>.  

<P>
My contribution is complementary to the global perspectives he outlined this morning. It is based on contributions to three fora he organized on:

<P>
Strengthening Strategic Approaches for Improving Health through Schools: 

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Global, 
<LI>
Regional, and 
<LI>
National Considerations
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
during the <A HREF="16wc.htm">XVI World Conference of the International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE)</A> in June of this year in Puerto Rico.  

<P>
I shared the Forum on Regional Considerations and I have to thank Jack Jones' colleague, Isolde Birdthistle, who acted as rapporteur to the three fora and prepared a report, which will soon be published in the <A HREF="journal.htm">IUHPE Journal</A>. She provided me with the manuscript.

<P>
In Puerto Rico, I was appointed Regional Director for the IUHPE South West Pacific Region, and it is in this role that I would like to contribute to the further development of health-promoting schools in the Region.  

<P>
You will notice when I describe the strategies in the <A HREF="http://www.wpro.who.int/themes_focuses/theme2/focus2/themes2_focus2a4.asp">Western Pacific Region of WHO</A> that I will be more detailed and perhaps more emotional than when talking about other Regions.  I hope you will forgive me this bias.  

<P>
But the development of health-promoting schools in the Western Pacific Region, which includes Australia, China, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, was at the heart of my seven years of work as Regional Adviser in Health Promotion and Mental Health in the Western Pacific Region.  

<P>
Many colleagues here in Australia have been supportive of this regional development and are still involved in it, and I would like to thank especially Louise Rowling, Lawry St Leger and Don Stewart for their important contributions.  I hope they will complement my presentation with their specific views and experiences.  

<P>
It would also be great if the participants from China, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand at this Conference would be willing to share with us if and how the regional strategies supported their work in developing health-promoting schools.

<P>
The development of health-promoting schools has its roots in the WHO Regions. It was initiated in <A HREF="http://www.who.dk/enhps/index.html">Europe</A>, then the <A HREF="http://www.wpro.who.int/themes_focuses/theme2/focus2/themes2_focus2a4.asp">Western Pacific Region</A> followed and currently it gains momentum in the <A HREF="http://www.paho.org/">Americas</A>.  

<P>
In the other WHO Regions, there has been for many years a focus on comprehensive school health education and health promotion, which has provided a foundation for schools realizing their potential as a healthy setting for living, learning and working.  

<P>
Today, there are efforts in all WHO Regions to help schools become health-promoting schools. They are supported by <A HREF="http://www.who.int/hpr/gshi/index.html">WHO's Global School Health Initiative (GSHI)</A>, which was launched in 1994.
