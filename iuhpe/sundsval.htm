<P><I>The Third International Conference on Health Promotion: Supportive
Environments for Health - the Sundsvall Conference - fits into a sequence
of events which began with the commitment of WHO to the goals of Health
For All (1977). This was followed by the UNICEF/WHO International Conference
on Primary Health Care, in Alma-Ata (1978), and the First International
Conference on Health Promotion in Industrialized Countries (Ottawa 1986).
Subsequent meetings on Healthy Public Policy, (Adelaide 1988) and a Call
for Action: Health Promotion in Developing countries, (Geneva 1989) have
further clarified the relevance and meaning of health promotion. In parallel
with these developments in the health arena, public concern over threats
to the global environment has grown dramatically. This was clearly expressed
by the World Commission on Environment and Development in its report Our
Common Future, which provided a new understanding of the imperative of
sustainable development.</I> </P>

<P>Third International Conference on Health Promotion: Supportive Environments
for Health - the first global conference on health promotion, with participants
from 81 countries - calls upon people in all parts of the world to actively
engage in making environments more supportive to health. Examining today's
health and environmental issues together, the Conference points out that
millions of people are living in extreme poverty and deprivation in an
increasingly degraded environment that threatens their health, making the
goal of Health For All by the Year 2000 extremely hard to achieve. The
way forward lies in making the environment - the physical environment,
the social and economic environment, and the political environment - supportive
to health rather than damaging to it. </P>

<P>The Sundsvall Conference identified many examples and approaches
for creating supportive environments that can be used by policy-makers,
decision-makers and community activists in the health and environment sectors.
The Conference recognized that everyone has a role in creating supportive
environments for health. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>A CALL FOR ACTION </FONT></P>

<P>This call for action is directed towards policy-makers and decision-makers
in all relevant sectors and at all levels. Advocates and activists for
health, environment and social justice are urged to form a broad alliance
towards the common goal of Health for All. We Conference participants have
pledged to take this message back to our communities, countries and governments
to initiate action. We also call upon the organizations of the United Nations
system to strengthen their cooperation and to challenge each other to be
truly committed to sustainable development and equity. </P>

<P>A supportive environment is of paramount importance for health. The
two are interdependent and inseparable. We urge that the achievement of
both be made central objectives in the setting of priorities for development,
and be given precedence in resolving competing interests in the everyday
management of government policies. </P>

<P>Inequities are reflected in a widening gap in health both within
our nations and between rich and poor countries. This is unacceptable.
Action to achieve social justice in health is urgently needed. Millions
of people are living in extreme poverty and deprivation in an increasingly
degraded environment in both urban and rural areas. An unforeseen and alarming
number of people suffer from the tragic consequences for health and well-being
of armed conflicts. Rapid population growth is a major threat to sustainable
development. People must survive without clean water, adequate food, shelter
or sanitation. </P>

<P>Poverty frustrates people's ambitions and their dreams of building
a better future, while limited access to political structures undermines
the basis for self-determination. For many, education is unavailable or
insufficient, or, in its present forms, fails to enable and empower. Millions
of children lack access to basic education and have little hope for a better
future. Women, the majority of the world's population, are still oppressed.
They are sexually exploited and suffer from discrimination in the labour
market and many other areas, preventing them from playing a full role in
creating supportive environments. </P>

<P>More than a billion people worldwide have inadequate access to essential
health care. Health care systems undoubtedly need to be strengthened. The
solution to these massive problems lies in social action for health and
the resources and creativity of individuals and their communities. Releasing
this potential requires a fundamental change in the way we view our health
and our environment, and a clear, strong political commitment to sustainable
health and environmental policies. The solutions lie beyond the traditional
health system. </P>

<P>Initiatives have to come from all sectors that can contribute to
the creation of supportive environments for health, and must be acted upon
by people in local communities, nationally by government and nongovernmental
organizations, and globally through international organizations. Action
will predominantly involve such sectors as education, transport, housing
and urban development, industrial production and agriculture. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>DIMENSIONS OF ACTION ON SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS FOR
HEALTH </FONT></P>

<P>In a health context the term supportive environments refers to both
the physical and the social aspects of our surroundings. It encompasses
where people live, their local community, their home, where they work and
play. It also embraces the framework which determines access to resources
for living, and opportunities for empowerment. Thus action to create supportive
environments has many dimensions: physical, social, spiritual, economic
and political. Each of these dimensions is inextricably linked to the others
in a dynamic interaction. Action must be coordinated at local, regional,
national and global levels to achieve solutions that are truly sustainable.
</P>

<P>The Conference highlighted four aspects of supportive environments:
</P>

<P>1. The social dimension, which includes the ways in which norms,
customs and social processes affect health. In many societies traditional
social relationships are changing in ways that threaten health, for example,
by increasing social isolation, by depriving life of a meaningful coherence
and purpose, or by challenging traditional values and cultural heritage.
</P>

<P>2. The political dimension, which requires governments to guarantee
democratic participation in decision-making and the decentralization of
responsibilities and resources. It also requires a commitment to human
rights, peace, and a shifting of resources from the arms race. </P>

<P>3. The economic dimension, which requires a re-channelling of resources
for the achievement of Health for All and sustainable development, including
the transfer of safe and reliable technology. </P>

<P>4. The need to recognize and use women's skills and knowledge in
all sectors - including policy-making, and the economy - in order to develop
a more positive infrastructure for supportive environments. The burden
of the workload of women should be recognized and shared between men and
women. Women's community-based organizations must have a stronger voice
in the development of health promotion policies and structures. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>PROPOSALS FOR ACTION </FONT></P>

<P>The Sundsvall Conference believes that proposals to implement the
Health for All strategies must reflect two basic principles: </P>

<P>1. Equity must be a basic priority in creating supportive environments
for health, releasing energy and creative power by including all human
beings in this unique endeavour. All policies that aim at sustainable development
must be subjected to new types of accountability procedures in order to
achieve an equitable distribution of responsibilities and resources. All
action and resource allocation must be based on a clear priority and commitment
to the very poorest, alleviating the extra hardship borne by the marginalized,
minority groups, and people with disabilities. The industrialized world
needs to pay the environmental and human debt that has accumulated through
exploitation of the developing world. </P>

<P>2. Public action for supportive environments for health must recognize
the interdependence of all living beings, and must manage all natural resources,
taking into account the needs of future generations. Indigenous peoples
have a unique spiritual and cultural relationship with the physical environment
that can provide valuable lessons for the rest of the world. It is essential,
therefore, that indigenous peoples be involved in sustainable development
activities, and negotiations be conducted about their rights to land and
cultural heritage. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>IT CAN BE DONE: STRENGTHENING SOCIAL ACTION </FONT></P>

<P>A call for the creation of supportive environments is a practical
proposal for public health action at the local level, with a focus on settings
for health that allow for broad community involvement and control. Examples
from all parts of the world were presented at the Conference in relation
to education, food, housing, social support and care, work and transport.
They clearly showed that supportive environments enable people to expand
their capabilities and develop self-reliance. Further details of these
practical proposals are available in the Conference report and handbook.
</P>

<P>Using the examples presented, the Conference identified four key
public health action strategies to promote the creation of supportive environments
at community level. </P>

<P>1. Strengthening advocacy through community action, particularly
through groups organized by women. </P>

<P>2. Enabling communities and individuals to take control over their
health and environment through education and empowerment. </P>

<P>3. Building alliances for health and supportive environments in order
to strengthen the cooperation between health and environmental campaigns
and strategies. </P>

<P>4. Mediating between conflicting interests in society in order to
ensure equitable access to supportive environments for health. </P>

<P>In summary, empowerment of people and community participation were
seen as essential factors in a democratic health promotion approach and
the driving force for self-reliance and development. </P>

<P>Participants in the Conference recognized, in particular, that education
is a basic human right and a key element in bringing about the political,
economic and social changes needed to make health a possibility for all.
Education should be accessible throughout life and be built on the principle
of equity, particularly with respect to culture, social class and gender.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE </FONT></P>

<P>People form an integral part of the earth's ecosystem. Their health
is fundamentally interlinked with the total environment. All available
information indicates that it will not be possible to sustain the quality
of life, for human beings and all living species, without drastic changes
in attitudes and behaviour at all levels with regard to the management
and preservation of the environment. </P>

<P>Concerted action to achieve a sustainable, supportive environment
for health is the challenge of our times. </P>

<P>At the international level, large differences in per capita income
lead to inequalities not only in access to health but also in the capacity
of societies to improve their situation and sustain a decent quality of
life for future generations. Migration from rural to urban areas drastically
increases the number of people living in slums, with accompanying problems
- including lack of clean water and sanitation. </P>

<P>Political decision-making and industrial development are too often
based on short-term planning and economic gains which do not take into
account the true costs to people's health and the environment. International
debt is seriously draining the scarce resources of the poor countries.
Military expenditure is increasing, and war, in addition to causing deaths
and disability, is now introducing new forms of ecological vandalism. </P>

<P>Exploitation of the labour force, the exportation and dumping of
hazardous substances, particularly in the weaker and poorer nations, and
the wasteful consumption of world resources all demonstrate that the present
approach to development is in crisis. There is an urgent need to advance
towards new ethics and global agreement based on peaceful coexistence to
allow for a more equitable distribution and utilization of the earth's
limited resources. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>ACHIEVING GLOBAL ACCOUNTABILITY </FONT></P>

<P>The Sundsvall Conference calls upon the international community to
establish nw mechanisms of health and ecological accountability that build
upon the principles of sustainable health development. In practice this
requires health and environmental impact statements for major policy and
programme initiatives. WHO and UNEP are urged to strengthen their efforts
to develop codes of conduct on the trade and marketing of substances and
products harmful to health and the environment. </P>

<P>WHO and UNEP are urged to develop guidelines based on the principle
of sustainable development for use by Member States. All multilateral and
bilateral donor and funding agencies such as the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund are urged to use such guidelines in planning, implementing
and assessing development projects. Urgent action needs to be taken to
support developing countries in identifying and applying their own solutions.
Close collaboration with nongovernmental organizations should be ensured
throughout the process. </P>

<P>The Sundsvall Conference has again demonstrated that the issues of
health, environment and human development cannot be separated. Development
must imply improvement in the quality of life and health while preserving
the sustainability of the environment. </P>

<P>The Conference participants therefore urge the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED), to be held in Rio de Janeiro in
1992, to take the Sundsvall Statement into account in its deliberations
on the Earth Charter and Agenda 21, which is to be an action plan leading
into the 21st century. Health goals must figure prominently in both. Only
worldwide action based on global partnership will ensure the future of
our planet. </P>
