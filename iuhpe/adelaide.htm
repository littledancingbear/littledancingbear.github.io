<I>The adoption of the Declaration of Alma-Ata a decade ago was a
major milestone in the Health for All movement which the World Health Assembly
launched in 1977. Building on the recognition of health as a fundamental
social goal, the Declaration set a new direction for health policy by emphasizing
people's involvement, cooperation between sectors of society. and primary
health care as its foundation. </I>
</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<UL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>THE SPIRIT OF ALMA-ATA </FONT>
</P>

<P>The spirit of Alma-Ata was carried forward in the Charter for Health
Promotion which was adopted in Ottawa in 1986. The Charter set the challenge
for a move towards the new public health by reaffirming social justice
and equity as prerequisites for health, and advocacy and mediation as the
processes for their achievement. </P>

<P>The Charter identified five health promotion action areas: </P>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>build Healthy Public Policy, </LI>

<LI>create supportive environments, </LI>

<LI>develop personal skills, </LI>

<LI>strengthen community action, and </LI>

<LI>reorient health services. </LI>
</UL>

<P>These actions are interdependent, but healthy public policy establishes
the environment that makes the other four possible. </P>

<P>The Adelaide Conference on Healthy Public Policy continued in the
direction set at Alma-Ata and Ottawa, and built on their momentum. Two
hundred and twenty participants from forty-two countries shared experiences
in formulating and implementing healthy public policy. The following recommended
strategies for healthy public policy action reflect the consensus achieved
at the Conference. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>HEALTHY PUBLIC POLICY </FONT></P>

<P>Healthy public policy is characterized by an explicit concern for
health and equity in all areas of policy and by an accountability for health
impact. The main aim of health public policy is to create a supportive
environment to enable people to lead healthy lives. Such a policy makes
health choices possible or easier for citizens. It makes social and physical
environments health-enhancing. In the pursuit of healthy public policy,
government sectors concerned with agriculture, trade, education, industry,
and communications need to take into account health as an essential factor
when formulating policy. These sectors should be accountable for the health
consequences of their policy decisions. They should pay as much attention
to health as to economic considerations. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The value of health </FONT></P>

<P>Health is both a fundamental human right and a sound social investment.
Governments need to invest resources in healthy public policy and health
promotion in order to raise the health status of all their citizens. A
basic principle of social justice is to ensure that people have access
to the essentials for a healthy and satisfying life. At the same time,
this raises overall societal productivity in both social and economic terms.
Healthy public policy in the short term will lead to long-term economic
benefits as shown by the case studies presented at this Conference. New
efforts must be made to link economic, social, and health policies into
integrated action. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Equity, access and development </FONT></P>

<P>Inequalities in health are rooted in inequities in society. Closing
the health gap between socially and educationally disadvantaged people
and more advantaged people requires a policy that will improve access to
health-enhancing goods and services, and create supportive environments.
Such a policy would assign high priority to underprivileged and vulnerable
groups. Furthermore, a healthy public policy recognizes the unique culture
of indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and immigrants. Equal access
to health services, particularly community health care, is a vital aspect
of equity in health. </P>

<P>New inequalities in health may follow rapid structural change caused
by emerging technologies. The first target of the European Region of the
World Health Organization, in moving towards Health for All is that: </P>

<UL>
<P><I>by the year 2000 the actual differences in health status between
countries and between groups within countries should be reduced by at least
25% by improving the level of health of disadvantaged nations and groups.</I>
</P>
</UL>

<P>In view of the large health gaps between countries, which this Conference
has examined, the developed countries have an obligation to ensure that
their own policies have a positive health impact on developing nations.
The Conference recommends that all countries develop healthy public policies
that explicitly address this issue. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HEALTH </FONT></P>

<P>The recommendations of this Conference will be realized only if governments
at national, regional and local levels take action. The development of
healthy public policy is as important at the local levels of government
as it is nationally. Governments should set explicit health goals that
emphasize health promotion. </P>

<P>Public accountability for health is an essential nutrient for the
growth of healthy public policy. Governments and all other controllers
of resources are ultimately accountable to their people for the health
consequences of their policies, or lack of policies. A commitment to healthy
public policy means that governments must measure and report the health
impact of their policies in language that all groups in society readily
understand. Community action is central to the fostering of healthy public
policy. Taking education and literacy into account, special efforts must
be made to communicate with those groups most affected by the policy concerned.
</P>

<P>The Conference emphasizes the need to evaluate the impact of policy.
Health information systems that support this process need to be developed.
This will encourage informed decision-making over the future allocation
of resources for the implementation of healthy public policy. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moving beyond health care </FONT></P>

<P>Healthy public policy responds to the challenges in health set by
an increasingly dynamic and technologically changing world, with is complex
ecological interactions and growing international interdependencies. Many
of the health consequences of these challenges cannot be remedied by present
and foreseeable health care. Health promotion efforts are essential, and
these require an integrated approach to social and economic development
which will re-establish the links between health and social reform, which
the World Health Organization policies of the past decade have addressed
as a basic principle. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Partners in the policy process </FONT></P>

<P>Government plays an important role in health, but health is also
influenced greatly by corporate and business interests, nongovernmental
bodies and community organizations. Their potential for preserving and
promoting people's health should be encouraged. Trade unions, commerce
and industry, academic associations and religious leaders have many opportunities
to act in the health interests of the whole community. New alliances must
be forged to provide the impetus for health action. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>ACTION AREAS </FONT></P>

<P>The Conference identified four key areas as priorities for health
public policy for immediate action: </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Supporting the health of women </FONT></P>

<P>Women are the primary health promoters all over the world, and most
of their work is performed without pay or for a minimal wage. Women's networks
and organizations are models for the process of health promotion organization,
planning and implementation. Women's networks should receive more recognition
and support from policy-makers and established institutions. Otherwise,
this investment of women's labour increases inequity. For their effective
participation in health promotion women require access to information,
networks and funds. All women, especially those from ethnic, indigenous,
and minority groups, have the right to self-determination of their health,
and should be full partners in the formulation of healthy public policy
to ensure its cultural relevance. </P>

<P>This Conference proposes that countries start developing a national
women's healthy public policy in which women's own health agendas are central
and which includes proposals for: </P>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>equal sharing of caring work performed in society; </LI>

<LI>birthing practices based on women's preferences and needs; </LI>

<LI>supportive mechanisms for caring work, such as support for mothers
with children, parental leave, and dependent health-care leave. </LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Food and nutrition </FONT></P>

<P>The elimination of hunger and malnutrition is a fundamental objective
of healthy public policy. Such policy should guarantee universal access
to adequate amounts of healthy food in culturally acceptable ways. Food
and nutrition policies need to integrate methods of food production and
distribution, both private and public, to achieve equitable prices. </P>

<P>A food and nutrition policy that integrates agricultural, economic,
and environmental factors to ensure a positive national and international
health impact should be a priority for all governments. The first stage
of such a policy would be the establishment of goals for nutrition and
diet. Taxation and subsidies should discriminate in favour of easy access
for all to healthy food and an improved diet. </P>

<P>The Conference recommends that governments take immediate and direct
action at all levels to use their purchasing power in the food market to
ensure that the food-supply under their specific control (such as catering
in hospitals, schools, day-care centres, welfare services and workplaces)
gives consumers ready access to nutritious food. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Tobacco and alcohol </FONT></P>

<P>The use of tobacco and the abuse of alcohol are two major health
hazards that deserve immediate action through the development of healthy
public policies. Not only is tobacco directly injurious to the health of
the smoker but the health consequences of passive smoking, especially to
infants, are now more clearly recognized than in the past. Alcohol contributes
to social discord, and physical and mental trauma. Additionally, the serious
ecological consequences of the use of tobacco as a cash crop in impoverished
economies have contributed to the current world crises in food production
and distribution. </P>

<P>The production and marketing of tobacco and alcohol are highly profitable
activities - especially to governments through taxation. Governments often
consider that the economic consequences of reducing the production and
consumption of tobacco and alcohol by altering policy would be too heavy
a price to pay for the health gains involved. </P>

<P>This Conference calls on all governments to consider the price they
are paying in lost human potential by abetting the loss of life and illness
that tobacco smoking and alcohol abuse cause. Governments should commit
themselves to the development of healthy public policy by setting nationally-determined
targets to reduce tobacco growing and alcohol production, marketing and
consumption significantly by the year 2000. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Creating supportive environments </FONT></P>

<P>Many people live and work in conditions that are hazardous to their
health and are exposed to potentially hazardous products. Such problems
often transcend national frontiers. Environmental management must protect
human health from the direct and indirect adverse effects of biological,
chemical, and physical factors, and should recognize that women and men
are part of a complex ecosystem. The extremely diverse but limited natural
resources that enrich life are essential to the human race. Policies promoting
health can be achieved only in an environment that conserves resources
through global, regional, and local ecological strategies. </P>

<P>A commitment by all levels of government is required. Coordinated
intersectoral efforts are needed to ensure that health considerations are
regarded as integral prerequisites for industrial and agricultural development.
At an international level, the World Health Organization should play a
major role in achieving acceptance of such principles and should support
the concept of sustainable development. </P>

<P>This Conference advocates that, as a priority, the public health
and ecological movements join together to develop strategies in pursuit
of socioeconomic development and the conservation of our planet's limited
resources. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>DEVELOPING NEW HEALTH ALLIANCES </FONT></P>

<P>The commitment to healthy public policy demands an approach that
emphasizes consultation and negotiation. Healthy public policy requires
strong advocates who put health high on the agenda of policy-makers. This
means fostering the work of advocacy groups and helping the media to interpret
complex policy issues. </P>

<P>Educational institutions must respond to the emerging needs of the
new public health by reorienting existing curricula to include enabling,
mediating, and advocating skills. There must be a power shift from control
to technical support in policy development. In addition, forums for the
exchange of experiences at local, national and international levels are
needed. </P>

<P>The Conference recommends that local, national and international
bodies: </P>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>establish clearing-houses to promote good practice in developing
healthy public policy; </LI>

<LI>develop networks of research workers, training personnel, and programme
managers to help analyse and implement healthy public policy. </LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>COMMITMENT TO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH </FONT></P>

<P>Prerequisites for health and social development are peace and social
justice; nutritious food and clean water; education and decent housing;
a useful role in society and an adequate income; conservation of resources
and the protection of the ecosystem. The vision of healthy public policy
is the achievement of these fundamental conditions for healthy living.
The achievement of global health rests on recognizing and accepting interdependence
both within and between countries. Commitment to global public health will
depend on finding strong means of international cooperation to act on the
issues that cross national boundaries. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>FUTURE CHALLENGES </FONT></P>

<P>1. Ensuring an equitable distribution of resources even in adverse
economic circumstances is a challenge for all nations. </P>

<P>2. Health for All will be achieved only if the creation and preservation
of healthy living and working conditions become a central concern in all
public policy decisions. Work in all its dimensions - caring work, opportunities
for employment, quality of working life -dramatically affects people's
health and happiness. The impact of work on health and equity needs to
be explored. </P>

<P>3. The most fundamental challenge for individual nations and international
agencies in achieving healthy public policy is to encourage collaboration
(or developing partnerships) in peace, human rights and social justice,
ecology, and sustainable development around the globe. </P>

<P>4. In most countries, health is the responsibility of bodies at different
political levels. In the pursuit of better health it is desirable to find
new ways for collaboration within and between these levels. </P>

<P>5. Healthy public policy must ensure that advances in health-care
technology help, rather than hinder, the process of achieving improvements
in equity. </P>

<P>The Conference strongly recommends that the World Health Organization
continue the dynamic development of health promotion through the five strategies
described in the Ottawa Charter. It urges the World Health Organization
to expand this initiative throughout all its regions as an integrated part
of its work. Support for developing countries is at the heart of this process.
</P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>RENEWAL OF COMMITMENT </FONT></P>

<P>In the interests of global health, the participants at the Adelaide
Conference urge all concerned to reaffirm the commitment to a strong public
health alliance that the Ottawa Charter called for. </P>
