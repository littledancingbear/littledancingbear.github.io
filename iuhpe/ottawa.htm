<FONT SIZE=+1>1st International Conference on Health Promotion (Ottawa,
Canada, November 1986)</FONT>
</CENTER>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><I>The first International Conference on Health Promotion, meeting
in Ottawa this 21st day of November 1986, hereby presents this CHARTER
for action to achieve Health for All by the year 2000 and beyond. </I></P>

<P><I>This conference was primarily a response to growing expectations
for a new public health movement around the world. Discussions focused
on the needs in industrialized countries, but took into account similar
concerns in all other regions. It built on the progress made through the
Declaration on Primary Health Care at Alma-Ata, the World Health Organization's
Targets for Health for All document, and the recent debate at the World
Health Assembly on intersectoral action for health. </I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>HEALTH PROMOTION </FONT></P>

<P>Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control
over, and to improve, their health. To reach a state of complete physical,
mental and social well-being, an individual or group must be able to identify
and to realize aspirations, to satisfy needs, and to change or cope with
the environment. Health is, therefore, seen as a resource for everyday
life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing
social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities. Therefore,
health promotion is not just the responsibility of the health sector, but
goes beyond healthy life-styles to well-being. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PREREQUISITES FOR HEALTH </FONT></P>

<P>The fundamental conditions and resources for health are: </P>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>peace, </LI>

<LI>shelter, </LI>

<LI>education, </LI>

<LI>food, </LI>

<LI>income, </LI>

<LI>a stable eco-system, </LI>

<LI>sustainable resources, </LI>

<LI>social justice, and </LI>

<LI>equity. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Improvement in health requires a secure foundation in these basic
prerequisites. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>ADVOCATE </FONT></P>

<P>Good health is a major resource for social, economic and personal
development and an important dimension of quality of life. Political, economic,
social, cultural, environmental, behavioural and biological factors can
all favour health or be harmful to it. Health promotion action aims at
making these conditions favourable through advocacy for health. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>ENABLE </FONT></P>

<P>Health promotion focuses on achieving equity in health. Health promotion
action aims at reducing differences in current health status and ensuring
equal opportunities and resources to enable all people to achieve their
fullest health potential. This includes a secure foundation in a supportive
environment, access to information, life skills and opportunities for making
healthy choices. People cannot achieve their fullest health potential unless
they are able to take control of those things which determine their health.
This must apply equally to women and men. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>MEDIATE </FONT></P>

<P>The prerequisites and prospects for health cannot be ensured by the
health sector alone. More importantly, health promotion demands coordinated
action by all concerned: by governments, by health and other social and
economic sectors, by nongovernmental and voluntary organization, by local
authorities, by industry and by the media. People in all walks of life
are involved as individuals, families and communities. Professional and
social groups and health personnel have a major responsibility to mediate
between differing interests in society for the pursuit of health </P>

<P>Health promotion strategies and programmes should be adapted to the
local needs and possibilities of individual countries and regions to take
into account differing social, cultural and economic systems. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>HEALTH PROMOTION ACTION MEANS: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>BUILD HEALTHY PUBLIC POLICY </FONT></P>

<P>Health promotion goes beyond health care. It puts health on the agenda
of policy makers in all sectors and at all levels, directing them to be
aware of the health consequences of their decisions and to accept their
responsibilities for health. </P>

<P>Health promotion policy combines diverse but complementary approaches
including legislation, fiscal measures, taxation and organizational change.
It is coordinated action that leads to health, income and social policies
that foster greater equity. Joint action contributes to ensuring safer
and healthier goods and services, healthier public services, and cleaner,
more enjoyable environments. </P>

<P>Health promotion policy requires the identification of obstacles
to the adoption of healthy public policies in non-health sectors, and ways
of removing them. The aim must be to make the healthier choice the easier
choice for policy makers as well. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CREATE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS </FONT></P>

<P>Our societies are complex and interrelated. Health cannot be separated
from other goals. The inextricable links between people and their environment
constitutes the basis for a socio-ecological approach to health. The overall
guiding principle for the world, nations, regions and communities alike,
is the need to encourage reciprocal maintenance - to take care of each
other, our communities and our natural environment. The conservation of
natural resources throughout the world should be emphasized as a global
responsibility. </P>

<P>Changing patterns of life, work and leisure have a significant impact
on health. Work and leisure should be a source of health for people. The
way society organizes work should help create a healthy society. Health
promotion generates living and working conditions that are safe, stimulating,
satisfying and enjoyable. </P>

<P>Systematic assessment of the health impact of a rapidly changing
environment - particularly in areas of technology, work, energy production
and urbanization - is essential and must be followed by action to ensure
positive benefit to the health of the public. The protection of the natural
and built environments and the conservation of natural resources must be
addressed in any health promotion strategy. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY ACTION </FONT></P>

<P>Health promotion works through concrete and effective community action
in setting priorities, making decisions, planning strategies and implementing
them to achieve better health. At the heart of this process is the empowerment
of communities - their ownership and control of their own endeavours and
destinies. </P>

<P>Community development draws on existing human and material resources
in the community to enhance self-help and social support, and to develop
flexible systems for strengthening public participation in and direction
of health matters. This requires full and continuous access to information,
learning opportunities for health, as well as funding support. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>DEVELOP PERSONAL SKILLS </FONT></P>

<P>Health promotion supports personal and social development through
providing information, education for health, and enhancing life skills.
By so doing, it increases the options available to people to exercise more
control over their own health and over their environments, and to make
choices conducive to health. </P>

<P>Enabling people to learn, throughout life, to prepare themselves
for all of its stages and to cope with chronic illness and injuries is
essential. This has to be facilitated in school, home, work and community
settings. Action is required through educational, professional, commercial
and voluntary bodies, and within the institutions themselves. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>REORIENT HEALTH SERVICES </FONT></P>

<P>The responsibility for health promotion in health services is shared
among individuals, community groups, health professionals, health service
institutions and governments. They must work together towards a health
care system which contributes to the pursuit of health. </P>

<P>The role of the health sector must move increasingly in a health
promotion direction, beyond its responsibility for providing clinical and
curative services. Health services need to embrace an expanded mandate
which is sensitive and respects cultural needs. This mandate should support
the needs of individuals and communities for a healthier life, and open
channels between the health sector and broader social, political, economic
and physical environmental components. </P>

<P>Reorienting health services also requires stronger attention to health
research as well as changes in professional education and training. This
must lead to a change of attitude and organization of health services which
refocuses on the total needs of the individual as a whole person. </P>

<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MOVING INTO THE FUTURE </FONT></P>

<P>Health is created and lived by people within the settings of their
everyday life; where they learn, work, play and love. Health is created
by caring for oneself and others, by being able to take decisions and have
control over one's life circumstances, and by ensuring that the society
one lives in creates conditions that allow the attainment of health by
all its members. </P>

<P>Caring, holism and ecology are essential issues in developing strategies
for health promotion. Therefore, those involved should take as a guiding
principle that, in each phase of planning, implementation and evaluation
of health promotion activities, women and men should become equal partners.
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>COMMITMENT TO HEALTH PROMOTION </FONT></P>

<P>The participants in this Conference pledge: </P>

<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
<LI>to move into the arena of healthy public policy, and to advocate
a clear political commitment to health and equity in all sectors; </LI>

<LI>to counteract the pressures towards harmful products, resource depletion,
unhealthy living conditions and environments, and bad nutrition; and to
focus attention on public health issues such as pollution, occupational
hazards, housing and settlements; </LI>

<LI>to respond to the health gap within and between societies, and to
tackle the inequities in health produced by the rules and practices of
these societies; </LI>

<LI>to acknowledge people as the main health resource; to support and
enable them to keep themselves, their families and friends healthy through
financial and other means, and to accept the community as the essential
voice in matters of its health, living conditions and well-being; </LI>

<LI>to reorient health services and their resources towards the promotion
of health; and to share power with other sectors, other disciplines and,
most importantly, with people themselves; </LI>

<LI>to recognize health and its maintenance as a major social investment
and challenge; and to address the overall ecological issue of our ways
of living. </LI>

<LI>The Conference urges all concerned to join them in their commitment
to a strong public health alliance. </LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>CALL FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTION </FONT></P>

<P>The Conference calls on the World Health Organization and other international
organizations to advocate the promotion of health in all appropriate forums
and to support countries in setting up strategies and programmes for health
promotion. </P>

<P>The Conference is firmly convinced that if people in all walks of
life, nongovernmental and voluntary organizations, governments, the World
Health Organization and all other bodies concerned join forces in introducing
strategies for health promotion, in line with the moral and social values
that form the basis of this CHARTER, Health For All by the year 2000 will
become a reality. </P>
