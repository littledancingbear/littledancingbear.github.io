<FONT SIZE=+2>31st Annual Conference of <A HREF="http://www.pha.org.au/">PHA</A></FONT>

</P>
</CENTER>

<P>
Who are we? How healthy are we? What is our place in the world? Let's reflect and consolidate on who we are, what we believe in, and what we are doing. We should not slip entirely into the parochial, let's look at who we are in the global context of the rise of economic rationalism, the shrinking public sector, increasing global corporatisation, increased information technology and increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunity. However, neither should the big picture so overwhelm us that we forget our own and other people's lived (health) experiences: both those that enrich and those that constrain our lives. 

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Theme</B>

<P>
Indigenous health, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, is the guiding theme of the conference. But it will be considered as a central issue in each of the plenary sessions. For too long, indigenous health has been marginalised, and the implications for wider public health practice have been ignored. 

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Specified subthemes</B>

<P>
<B>1.  Our selves</B>

<P>
Explanation: We need to assess 'our selves' as public health workers and as citizens in an increasingly individualistic society, and assess our values.

<P>
Key questions: How do our roles as citizens overlap with and differ from our roles as professionals? What role do family and social networks play in our lives? Why do we feel comfortable talking about culture, but avoid its constitutive elements such as religion and spirituality? What can we learn from art and literature? Has the sociology of the body and embodiment affected the way we view health and deal with others? What role did public health professionals play in the stolen generation era?

<P>
Key topics: 

<UL>
<LI>
The stolen generation
<LI>
Aboriginal perspectives of family, spirituality, embodiment
<LI>
Euthanasia
</LI>
</UL>

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>2. Our community</B>

<P>
Explanation: Increasing emphasis (lip-service?) is put on the role of community participation in health. But at the same time, we are increasingly unsure whether we really are one community or a series of small flexible groupings within society. Is there such a thing as a collective Australian identity? Community organisations and consumer groups fill the gap between government and people, but face the criticism that they are not 'representative'.

<P>
Key questions: What is 'representation'? What is the role of community organisations and consumer groups in health? How do they network with each other? How do they lobby government for changes to health policy and to public policy with implications for health (e.g. uranium mining)? What is the role of the media in developing community participation?

<P>
Key topics:

<UL>
<LI>
Aboriginal community-controlled organisations
<LI>
Uranium mining and health as a case study in public policy
</LI>
</UL>
		
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>3.  Our country</B>

<P>
Explanation: The word country signifies a physical place as well as an imagined community. Environmental concerns cannot be separated from a vision of a fair society where resources are distributed equitably. Indigenous peoples have played a key role in rethinking the relationships between land and health.

<P>
Key questions: What does caring for country mean? How important is the concept of 'place' in public health? How are indigenous links to country relevant to health? Native title is a key justice issue, but is it also a health issue? How should we approach environmental health problems as we move into the next century? How can we address poverty and inequality at the same time?

<P>
Key topic:

<UL>
<LI>
Land and environment
</LI>
</UL>

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>4.  Our region</B>

<P>
Explanation: Australia still struggles with its role in the Asia-Pacific Region, adopting big-brother attitudes to Pacific nations while striving for acceptance in the ASEAN region. At the same time, it remains strangely unaffected by the regional conflicts that rage nearby. Darwin is located close to the conflicts in East Timor, Irian Jaya and Bougainville. The city is home to a large population of East Timorese refugees some of whom have acted as a focus for resistance to the Indonesian occupation.

<P>
Key questions: What is the role of Australia in the region in relation to public health? How does the history of the Asia-Pacific region affect these interactions? Does colonialism still exist? What similarities and differences are there between the history of colonialism within Australia and within the region? How healthy is Australia's foreign policy and refugee policy? Is there strategic value in linking the indigenous health struggle with that of other minorities overseas?

<P>
Key topics: 		

<UL>
<LI>
Regional conflicts and health (Bougainville, East Timor, Indonesia, Phillipines)
<LI>
The health of refugees in Australia
</LI>
</UL>

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>5.  Our world</B>

<P>
Explanation: The rapid forces of globalisation affecting trade and information services are impacting on health in particular ways in particular places. We have only to look at the recent Asian currency crisis. Australian governments have been enthusiastically implementing many aspects of free-market economic theory (e.g. user-pays, privatisation, competition policy, enterprise bargaining etc) with little consideration of possible health impacts.

<P>
Key questions: How exactly does globalisation affect public health?  Does 'corporate colonialism' have an effect on health? What is the role of the media and new technology in making sense of globalisation? Does globalisation present opportunities to improve health? What are the roles of international treaties/ covenants in determining domestic policy, especially indigenous health policy?

<P>
Key topics:

<UL>
<LI>
Globalisation
<LI>
Health and public health policy in Australia
</LI>
</UL>

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>6.  Our future</B>

<P>
Explanation: As Australia moves moves towards a republic and a new millennium, we need to consider what kind of country and society we want to develop. 

<P>
Key questions: What is reconciliation and how does it affect the relationship between colonised peoples and the state? Does studying the history of public health help us today? Is constitutional reform relevant to public health?

<P>
Key topic:

<UL>
<LI>
Reconciliation in Australia and overseas
</LI>
</UL>
