<P>Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '97: Wear sunscreen.</P>

<P>If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen
would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been probed
by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more
reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this
advice now.</P>

<P>Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You
will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've
faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of
yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility
lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not
as fat as you can imagine.</P>

<P>Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying
is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing
bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things
that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blind side
you at 4 pm on some idle Tuesday.</P>

<P>Do one thing every day that scares you.</P>

<P>Sing.</P>

<P>Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up
with people who are reckless with yours.</P>

<P>Floss.</P>

<P>Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead,
sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's
only with yourself.</P>

<P>Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you
succeed in doing this, tell me how.</P>

<P>Keep your old love letters.Throw away your old bank statements.</P>

<P>Stretch.</P>

<P>Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they
wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds
I know still don't know.</P>

<P>Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them
when they're gone.</P>

<P>Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children,
maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance
the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you
do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either.
Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.</P>

<P>Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid
of it or of what other other people think of it. It's the greatest
instrument you'll ever own.</P>

<P>Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.</P>

<P>Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.</P>

<P>Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel
ugly.</P>

<P>Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone
for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to
your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the
future.</P>

<P>Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few
you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography
and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the
people who knew you when you were young.</P>

<P>Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard.
Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you
soft.</P>

<P>Travel.</P>

<P>Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians
will philander. You, too, will get old. And then you do you'll
fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians
were noble, and children respected their elders. Respect your
elders.</P>

<P>Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust
fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when
either one might run out.</P>

<P>Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40
it will look like 85.</P>

<P>Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those
who supply it.</P>

<P>Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing
the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly
parts and recycling it for more that it's worth.</P>

<P>But trust me on the sunscreen.</P>
