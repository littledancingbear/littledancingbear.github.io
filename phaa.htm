We have tried to get this letter published in the Newsletter of the <a href="http://www.phaa.net.au/">PHAA</a>, <i><a href="http://www.phaa.net.au/intouch/frame_intouch.html">InTouch</a></i>, however we were told that there was no space available to publish the letter. 
<p>
Thus we decided to publish it ourselves via e-mail, list-services and this web-page.
<p>
We leave it to you to draw conclusions regarding the performance of the Executive of PHAA.

The Editor
<br>
<i>In-Touch</i> - Newsletter of the Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA)

<br>
<br>
<br>

Dear Editor:

<p>
as former SIG convenors we write to inform fellow PHAA members of our
concerns over the manner in which the previous Executive Director, Lynne
Flemming was dismissed and the reasons for us resigning from our positions
as SIG convenors.  We would like to express these concerns openly and to
encourage members to consider the issues raised when voting for a new
Executive and Council for PHAA.

<p>
First, we would like to publicly apologise to Lynne Flemming for the
manner in which she was dismissed by the PHAA Council.  We hold Lynne in
high regard and believe her dismissal did not reflect her valuable
contribution to the work, reputation and influence of PHAA.  As SIG
convenors, we have always had enormous support from Lynne and we cannot
fathom the reasons for her very sudden termination.

<p>
Second, although two of us were present at the Council meeting that voted
to dismiss Lynne (one as a voting member of Council), we are concerned
that not all members present understood what was happening and what the
implications were. Some Council members still do not have access to the
details as to why she was dismissed.

<p>
Third, we are particularly concerned about the representation of SIGs on
the Executive and the Council. The SIG convenors' representative did not
convey to SIG convenors prior to the Council meeting the issues that were
being raised and discussed about Lynne's position or the likely dismissal.
As a consequence, we feel that the vote conducted at Council was not truly
representative and that we were not able to participate in an informed
manner. Currently all Branch presidents (7/7) have a vote at Council
whereas only four (4/13) SIG convenors have a vote. We feel that this is
inequitable and does not reflect the important and active role that SIGs
play in the working of PHAA. The composition of voters at the April 2000
meeting may have been in accordance with the current constitution of PHAA
and we cannot argue with this. However, we are concerned to ensure that
this situation can not be repeated and we are therefore bringing this
inequity to your attention. As SIG convenors we have had access to a
consultant's report that describes options for governance of PHAA. From
this a new governance review team has been appointed which we hope will
ensure that the future governance of PHAA is more representative.

<p>
Overall, we are disappointed in the PHAA executive for handling the matter
in the way they have. We have been informed that it was in accordance with
the PHAA constitution and with Lynne's contract of appointment, but we are
ashamed that an organisation that represents public health professionals
who generally value consultation, transparency, honesty, conflict
resolution and informed participation could have acted not only to stifle
discussion of the reasons for Lynne's dismissal, but to effectively
terminate a person's employment on the spot, with no opportunity for that
person to respond and without going through a normal grievance procedure.

<p>
We made the decision to resign as SIG convenors because we were ashamed of
the way this situation was handled, and because we no longer wanted to
contribute to an organisation that would treat its employees so poorly.

<p>
Since the April Council meeting we have been part of a group of concerned
members calling for greater transparency and information to members about
the events leading to Lynne's dismissal. So far we have been unsuccesful
in either arranging an extraordinary General Meeting to inform members or
in having a letter signed by us all circulted via the PHAA listserve.  We
are currently hoping that members are made aware of the findings of the
consultant's report before they are asked to vote for a new Executive and
Council.

<p>
The Public Health Association of Australia needs to conduct its
business in a way which is conducive to health for both staff and
members if it is to have legitimacy in its influence on the health of the
wider community. We do believe that workplace health promotion is a matter
of quality management on all levels of any organization, particularly
regarding the well-being of staff members.

<p>
Our decision to write this letter has been made with a deep commitment to
public health in Australia. All three of us are saddened by what has
happened, but we are also convinced that this sadness can be transferred
to strength if we are able to analyse and respond appropriately to what
has happened.

<p>
To be able to generate this strength, we need to be able to stand up and
say what we want - in public.
