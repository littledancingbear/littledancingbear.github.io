<!Government and Laws, 1987 Constitution, Article XII, National
Economy and Patrimony>
<H3><B>The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines 
</B></H3>
<HR>

<H3><B>ARTICLE XII</B></H3>

<H4><B>National Economy and Patrimony</B></H4>

<P>
Section 1. The goals of the national economy are a more equitable
distribution of opportunities, income, and wealth; a sustained
increase in the amount of goods and services produced by the nation
for the benefit of the people; and an expanding productivity as
the key to raising the quality of life for all, especially the
underprivileged.
<P>
The State shall promote industrialization and full employment
based on sound agricultural development and agrarian reform, through
industries that make full and efficient use of human and natural
resources, and which are competitive in both domestic and foreign
markets. However, the State shall protect Filipino enterprises
against unfair foreign competition and trade practices.
<P>
In the pursuit of these goals, all sectors of the economy and
all regions of the country shall be given optimum opportunity
to develop. Private enterprises, including corporations, cooperatives,
and similar collective organizations, shall be encouraged to broaden
the base of their ownership.
<P>
Section 2. All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal,
petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy,
fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other
natural resources are owned by the State. With the exception of
agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated.
The exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources
shall be under the full control and supervision of the State.
The State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter
into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreements
with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at least
sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens. Such
agreements may be for a period not exceeding twenty-five years,
renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and under such
terms and conditions as may be provided by law. In cases of water
rights for irrigation, water supply fisheries, or industrial uses
other than the development of water power, beneficial use may
be the measure and limit of the grant.
<P>
The State shall protect the nation's marine wealth in its archipelagic
waters, territorial sea, and exclusive economic zone, and reserve
its use and enjoyment exclusively to Filipino citizens.
<P>
The Congress may, by law, allow small-scale utilization of natural
resources by Filipino citizens, as well as cooperative fish farming,
with priority to subsistence fishermen and fish- workers in rivers,
lakes, bays, and lagoons.
<P>
The President may enter into agreements with foreign-owned corporations
involving either technical or financial assistance for large-scale
exploration, development, and utilization of minerals, petroleum,
and other mineral oils according to the general terms and conditions
provided by law, based on real contributions to the economic growth
and general welfare of the country. In such agreements, the State
shall promote the development and use of local scientific and
technical resources.
<P>
The President shall notify the Congress of every contract entered
into in accordance with this provision, within thirty days from
its execution.
<P>
Section 3. Lands of the public domain are classified into agricultural,
forest or timber, mineral lands and national parks. Agricultural
lands of the public domain may be further classified by law according
to the uses to which they may be devoted. Alienable lands of the
public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands. Private
corporations or associations may not hold such alienable lands
of the public domain except by lease, for a period not exceeding
twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years,
and not to exceed one thousand hectares in area. Citizens of the
Philippines may lease not more than five hundred hectares, or
acquire not more than twelve hectares thereof by purchase, homestead,
or grant.
<P>
Taking into account the requirements of conservation, ecology,
and development, and subject to the requirements of agrarian reform,
the Congress shall determine, by law, the size of lands of the
public domain which may be acquired, developed, held, or leased
and the conditions therefor.
<P>
Section 4. The Congress shall, as soon as possible, determine
by law the specific limits of forest lands and national parks,
marking clearly their boundaries on the ground. Thereafter, such
forest lands and national parks shall be conserved and may not
be increased nor diminished, except by law. The Congress shall
provide, for such period as it may determine, measures to prohibit
logging in endangered forests and watershed areas.
<P>
Section 5. The State, subject to the provisions of this Constitution
and national development policies and programs, shall protect
the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral
lands to ensure their economic, social, and cultural well-being.
<P>
The Congress may provide for the applicability of customary laws
governing property rights or relations in determining the ownership
and extent of ancestral domain.
<P>
Section 6. The use of property bears a social function, and all
economic agents shall contribute to the common good. Individuals
and private groups, including corporations, cooperatives, and
similar collective organizations, shall have the right to own
establish, and operate economic enterprises, subject to the duty
of the State to promote distributive justice and to intervene
when the common good so demands.
<P>
Section 7. Save in cases of hereditary succession, no private
lands shall be transferred or conveyed except to individuals,
corporations, or associations qualified to acquire or hold lands
of the public domain.

<P>
Section 9. The Congress may establish an independent economic

and planning agency, when the national interest dictates, reserve

of investments. The Congress shall enact measures that will encourage

centum</I> of whose capital is owned by such citizens, nor shall
such franchise, certificate, or authorization be exclusive in
character or for a longer period than fifty years. Neither shall
any such franchise or right be granted except under the condition
that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by
the Congress when the common good so requires. The State shall
encourage equity participation in public utilities by the general
public. The participation of foreign investors in the governing
body of any public utility enterprise shall be limited to their
proportionate share in its capital, and all the executive and
managing officers of such corporation or association must be
citizens of the Philippines.
<P>
Section 12. The State shall promote the preferential use of Filipino
labor, domestic materials and locally produced goods, and adopt
measures that help make them competitive.

exchange on the basis of equality and reciprocity.

established by special charters in the interest of the common
good and subject to the test of economic viability.

terms prescribed by it, temporarily take over or direct the operation
of any privately owned public utility or business affected with
public interest.

be natural-born Filipino citizens, of known probity, integrity,
and patriotism, the majority of whom shall come from the private
sector. They shall also be subject to such other qualifications
and disabilities as may be prescribed by law. The authority shall
provide policy direction in the areas of money, banking, and credit.
It shall have supervision over the operations of banks and exercise
such regulatory powers as may be provided by law over the operations
of finance companies and other institutions performing similar
functions.
