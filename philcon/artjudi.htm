<P>
Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court
and in such lower courts as may be established by law.
<P>
Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle
actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable
and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been
a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction
on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.
<P>
Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe,
and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts but may not
deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over cases enumerated
in Section 5 hereof.
<P>
No law shall be passed reorganizing the Judiciary when it under-mines
the security of tenure of its Members.
<P>
Section 3. The Judiciary shall enjoy fiscal autonomy. Appropriations
for the Judiciary may not be reduced by the legislature below
the amount appropriated for the previous year and, after approval,
shall be automatically and regularly released.
<P>
Section 4. (1) The Supreme Court shall be composed of a Chief
Justice and fourteen Associate Justices. It may sit<I> en banc</I> or
in its discretion, in division of three, five, or seven Members.
Any vacancy shall be filled within ninety days from the occurrence
thereof.
<P>
(2) All cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, international
or executive agreement, or law, which shall be heard by the Supreme
Court<I> en banc</I>, and all other cases which under the Rules of Court
are required to be heard<I> en banc</I>, including those involving the
constitutionality, application, or operation of presidential decrees,
proclamations, orders, instructions, ordinances, and other regulations,
shall be decided with the concurrence of a majority of the Members
who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the
case and voted thereon.
<P>
(3) Cases or matters heard by a division shall be decided or resolved
with the concurrence of a majority of the Members who actually
took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case and voted
thereon, and in no case, without the concurrence of at least three
of such Members. When the required number is not obtained, the
case shall be decided<I> en banc</I>: Provided, that no doctrine or principle
of law laid down by the court in a decision rendered<I> en banc</I> or
in division may be modified or reversed except by the court sitting
en banc.
<P>
Section 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:

or toll, or any penalty imposed in relation thereto.

consultation before the case is assigned to a Member for the writing
of the opinion of the Court. A certification to this effect signed
