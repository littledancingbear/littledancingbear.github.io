<P>
Section 1.   The executive power shall be vested in the President
of the Philippines.
<P>
Section 2.   No person may be elected President unless he is a

election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years
immediately preceding such election.
<P>
Section 3.   There shall be a Vice-President who shall have the
same qualifications and term of office and  be elected with and
in the same manner as the President. He may be removed from office
in the same manner as the President.
<P>
The Vice-President may be appointed as a Member of the Cabinet.
Such appointment requires no confirmation.
<P>
Section 4.   The President and the Vice-President shall be elected
by direct vote of the people for a term of  six years which shall
begin at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following the

as such for more than four years shall be qualified for election
to the same office at any time.
<P>
No Vice-President shall serve for more than two successive terms.
Voluntary renunciation of the office for any length of time shall

<P>
Unless  otherwise provided by law, the regular election for President
and Vice-President shall be held on the second Monday of May.
<P>
The returns of every election for President and Vice-President,

of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the
President of the Senate shall, not later than thirty days after
the day of the election, open all the certificates in the presence
of the Senate and the House of Representatives in joint public
session, and the Congress, upon determination of the authenticity

the votes.
<P>
The person having the highest number of votes shall be proclaimed

number of votes, one of them shall forthwith be chosen by the
vote of a majority of all the Members of both Houses of the Congress,
voting separately.
<P>
The Congress shall promulgate its rules for the canvassing of
the certificates.
<P>
The Supreme Court, sitting <I>en banc</I>, shall be the sole judge
of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications
of the President or Vice-President, and may promulgate its rules
for the purpose.
<P>
Section 5.   Before they enter on the execution of their office,
the President, the Vice-President, or the Acting President shall
take the following oath or affirmation:
<p>
<b><I>    &quot;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully 
and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President (or Vice-President
or Acting President) of the Philippines, preserve and defend its 
Constitution, execute its laws, do justice to every  man, and  
consecrate  myself  to  the  service of the Nation. So help me  
God.&quot; (In  case of  affirmation, last sentence will be omitted.)</B></I>


<P>
Section 6.   The President shall have an official residence. The
salaries of the President and Vice-President shall be determined
by law and shall not be decreased during their tenure. No increase

of the term of the incumbent during which such increase was approved.
They shall not receive during their tenure any other emolument
from the Government or any other source.
<P>
Section 7.   The President-elect and the Vice-President-elect

If the President-elect fails to qualify, the Vice-President-elect
shall act as President until the President-elect shall have qualified.
<P>

shall act as President until a President shall have been chosen
and qualified.

If at the beginning of the term of the President, the President-elect
shall have died or shall have become permanently disabled, the
Vice-President-elect shall become President.
<P>
Where no President and Vice-President shall have been chosen or
shall have qualified, or where both shall have died or become
permanently disabled, the President of the Senate or, in case
of his inability, the Speaker of the House of Representatives
shall act as President until a President or a Vice-President shall
have been chosen and qualified.
<P>
The Congress shall, by law, provide for the manner in which one
who is to act as President shall be selected until a President
or a Vice-President shall have qualified, in case of death, permanent
disability, or inability of the officials mentioned in the next
preceding paragraph.
<P>
Section 8.   In case of death, permanent disability, removal from
office, or resignation of the President, the Vice-President shall
become the President to serve the unexpired term. In case of death,
permanent disability, removal from office, or resignation of both
the President and Vice-President, the President of the Senate
or, in case of his inability, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
shall then act as President until the President or Vice-President
shall have been elected and qualified.
<P>
The Congress shall, by law, provide who shall serve as President
in case of death, permanent disability, or resignation of the
Acting President. He shall serve until the President or the Vice-President
shall have been elected and qualified, and be subject to the same
restrictions of powers and disqualifications as the Acting President.
<P>
Section 9.   Whenever there is a vacancy in the Office of the
Vice-President during the term for which he was elected, the President
shall nominate a Vice-President from among the Members of the
Senate and the House of Representatives who shall assume office
upon confirmation by a majority vote of all the Members of both
Houses of the Congress, voting separately.
<P>
Section 10.   The Congress shall, at ten o'clock in the morning
of the third day after the vacancy in the offices of the President
and Vice-President occurs, convene in accordance with its rules
without need of a call and within seven days enact a law calling
for a special election to elect a President  and a Vice-President
to be held not earlier than forty-five days nor later than sixty
days from the time of such call. The bill calling such special
election shall be deemed certified under paragraph 2, Section
26, Article V1 of this Constitution and shall become law upon
its approval on third reading by the Congress. Appropriations
for the special election shall be charged against any current
appropriations and shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph
4, Section 25, Article V1 of this Constitution. The convening
of the Congress cannot be suspended nor the special election postponed.
No special election shall be called if the vacancy occurs within
eighteen months before the date of the next presidential election.
<P>
Section 11.   Whenever the President transmits to the President
of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of  Representatives
his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers
and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written
declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged
by the Vice-President as Acting President.
<P>
Whenever a majority of all the Members of the Cabinet transmit
to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House
of Representatives their written declaration that the President
is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the
Vice-President shall immediately assume the powers and duties
of the office as Acting President.
<P>
Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President of the
Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives his
written declaration that no inability exists, he shall reassume
the powers and duties of his office. Meanwhile, should a majority
of all the Members of the Cabinet transmit within five days to
the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives their written declaration that the President is
unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Congress
shall decide the issue. For that purpose, the Congress shall convene,
if it is not in session, within forty-eight hours, in accordance
with its rules and without need of call.
<P>
If the Congress, within ten days after receipt of the last written
declaration, or, if not in session, within twelve days after it
is required to assemble, determines by a two-thirds vote of both
Houses, voting separately, that the President is unable to discharge
the powers and duties of his office, the Vice- President shall
act as President; otherwise, the President shall continue exercising
the powers and duties of his office.
<P>
Section 12.   In case of serious illness of the President, the
public shall be informed of the state of his health. The members
of the Cabinet in charge of national security and foreign relations
and the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,
shall not be denied access to the President during such illness.
<P>
Section 13.   The President, Vice-President, the Members of the
Cabinet, and their deputies or assistants shall not, unless otherwise
provided in this Constitution, hold any other office or employment
during their tenure. They shall not, during said tenure, directly
or indirectly, practice any other profession, participate in any
business, or be financially interested in any contract with, or
in any franchise, or special privilege granted by the Government
or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including
government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.
They shall strictly avoid conflict of interest in the conduct
of their office.
<P>
The spouse and relatives by consanguinity or affinity within the
fourth civil degree of the President shall not during his tenure
be appointed as Members of the Constitutional Commissions, or
the Office of the Ombudsman, or a Secretaries, Undersecretaries,
chairmen or heads of bureaus or offices, including government-owned
or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries.
<P>
Section 14.   Appointments extended by an Acting President shall
remain effective, unless revoked by the elected President within
ninety days from his assumption or reassumption of office.
<P>
Section 15.   Two months immediately before the next presidential
elections and up to the end of his term, a President or Acting
President shall not make appointments, except temporary appointments
to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice
public service or endanger public safety.
<P>
Section 16.   The President shall nominate and, with the consent
of the Commission on Appointments, appoint the heads of the executive
departments, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,
or officers of the armed forces from the rank of colonel or naval
captain, and other officers whose appointments are vested in him
in this Constitution. He shall also appoint all other officers
of the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided
for by law, and those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint.
The Congress may, by law, vest the appointment of other officers
lower in rank in the President alone, in the courts, or in the
heads of departments, agencies, commissions, or boards.
<P>
The President shall have the power to make appointments during
the recess of the Congress, whether  voluntary or compulsory,
but such appointments shall be effective only until disapproval
by the Commission on Appointments or until the next adjournment
of the Congress.
<P>
Section 17.   The President shall have control of all the executive
departments, bureaus, and offices. He  shall ensure that the laws
be faithfully executed.
<P>
Section 18.   The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of
all armed forces of the Philippines and  whenever it becomes necessary,
he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless
violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion,
when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding
sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of <I>habeas corpus</I>
or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.
Within forty-eight hours from the proclamation of martial law
or the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <I>habeas corpus</I>,
the President shall submit a report in person or in writing to
the Congress. The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least
a majority of all its Members in regular or special session, may
revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set
aside by the President. Upon the initiative of the President, the Congress
may, in the same manner, extend such proclamation or suspension for a
period to be determined by the Congress, if the invasion or rebellion 
shall persist and public safety requires it.
<P>
The Congress, if not in session, shall, within  twenty-four hours
following such proclamation or  suspension, convene in accordance
with its rules without need of a call.
<P>
The Supreme Court may review, in an appropriate proceeding filed
by any citizen, the sufficiency of the factual basis of the proclamation
of martial law or the suspension of the privilege of the writ
or the extension thereof, and must promulgate its decision thereon
within thirty days from its filing.
<P>
A state of martial law does not suspend the operation of the Constitution,
nor supplant the functioning of the civil courts or legislative
assemblies, nor authorize the conferment of jurisdiction on military
courts and agencies over civilians where civil courts are able
to function, nor automatically suspend the privilege of the writ.
<P>
The suspension of the privilege of the writ shall apply only to
persons judicially charged for rebellion or offenses inherent
in or directly connected with invasion.
<P>
During the suspension of the privilege of the writ, any person
thus arrested or detained shall be judicially charged within three
days, otherwise he shall be released.
<P>
Section 19.   Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise
provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves,
commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after
conviction by final judgment.
<P>
He shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence
of a majority of all the Members of  the Congress.
<P>
Section 20.   The President may  contract or guarantee foreign
loans on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines with the prior
concurrence of the Monetary Board, and subject to such limitations
as may be provided by law. The Monetary Board shall, within  thirty
days from the end of every quarter of the calendar year, submit
to the Congress a complete report of its decision on applications
for loans to be contracted or guaranteed by the Government or
government-owned and controlled corporations which would have
the effect of increasing the foreign debt, and containing other
matters as may be provided by law.
<P>
Section 21.   No treaty or international agreement shall be valid
and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all
the Members of the Senate. 
<P>
Section 22.   The  President shall submit to the Congress within
thirty days from the opening of every regular session, as the
basis of the general appropriations bill, a budget of expenditures
and sources of financing, including receipts from existing and
proposed revenue measures.
<P>
Section 23.   The President shall address the Congress at the
opening of its regular session. He may also appear before it at
any other time.
