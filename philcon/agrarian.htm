<!Government and Laws, 1987 Constitution, Article XIII, Agrarian
and Natural Resources Reform>
<H2><B>The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines</B></H2>
<HR>

<H3><B>Agrarian and Natural Resources Reform</B></H3>

<P>
   Sec. 4.   The State shall, by law, undertaken an agrarian reform
program founded on the right of farmers and regular farmworkers,
who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they
till or in the case of other farmworkers, to receive a just share
of the fruits thereof. To this end, the State shall encourage
and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands,
subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as
the Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental,
or equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation.
In determining retention limits, the State shall respect the right
of small landowners. The State shall further provide incentives
for voluntary land-sharing.
<P>
   Sec. 5.   The State shall recognize the right of farmers, farmworkers,
and landowners, as well as cooperatives, and other independent
farmers' organizations to participate in the planning, organization,
and management of the program, and shall provide support to agriculture
through appropriate technology and research, and adequate financial,
production, marketing, and other support services.
<P>
   Sec. 6.   The State shall apply the principles of agrarian
reform or stewardship, whenever applicable in accordance with
law, in the disposition or utilization of other natural resources,
including lands of the public domain under lease or concession
suitable to agriculture, subject to prior rights, homestead rights
of small settlers, and the rights of indigenous communities to
their ancestral lands.
<P>
The State may resettle landless farmers and farmworkers in its
own agricultural estates which shall be distributed to them in
the manner provided by law.
<P>
   Sec. 7.   The State shall protect the rights of subsistence
fishermen, especially of local communities, to the preferential
use of the communal marine and fishing resources, both inland
and offshore. It shall provide support to such fishermen through
appropriate technology and research, adequate financial, production,
and marketing assistance, and other services. The State shall
also protect, develop, and conserve such resources. The protection
shall extend to offshore fishing grounds of subsistence fishermen
against foreign intrusion. Fishworkers shall receive a just share
from their labor in the utilization of marine and fishing resources.
<P>
   Sec. 8.   The State shall provide incentives to landowners
to invest the proceeds of the agrarian reform program to promote
industrialization, employment creation, and privatization of public
sector enterprises. Financial instruments used as payment for
their lands shall  be honored as equity in enterprises of their
choice.<HR>
