<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Diana Gribble: </P>

<P><I>Welcome to the 1995 Boyer Lectures series entitled titled A TRULY
CIVIL SOCIETY.</I> </P>

<P><I>I'm Diana Gribble. Deputy Chair of the ABC Board. It's my great pleasure
to introduce you to Eva Cox, who will be familiar to many of you as a formidable
social activist and commentator.</I> </P>

<P><I>During the past three weeks Eva Cox has argued passionately for a
radical re-thinking of our concept of citizenship.</I> </P>

<P><I>She argues that at a time when the polls are showing a growing anxiety
in the Ausralian population and the gap between rich and poor is widening,
there is a danger that we will retreat from participating in public life,
preferring the comfort of small closed communities.</I> </P>

<P><I>Today in her fourth lecture, The Companionable State, Eva Cox discusses
the pivotal place of central government in building a civil society.</I>
</P>

<P>

<H2><B>The companionable state</B> </H2>

<P>Eva Cox: </P>

<P>I was haunted by a line of poetry which expressed my fears of what might
happen to our world as we know it. I found the line in Yeats and here is
the verse: </P>

<UL>
<DT><I>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</I> </DT>

<DT><I>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</I> </DT>

<DT><I>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere</I> </DT>

<DT><I>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</I> </DT>

<DT><I>The best lack all conviction, while the worst </I></DT>

<DT><I>Are full of passionate intensity...</I> </DT>
</UL>

<P>Interestingly, this poem - 'The Second Coming' - has touched enough
writers to be constantly quoted in tomes across the political spectrum.
Like Yeats, I need a centre which holds. My need is an odd one in some
ways, because I also need to make sure the centre is accountable and represents
the will of the people. Why would I support a political centre which so
often represents other interests? </P>

<P>I am all too aware of the perils, as well as the advantages of the state.
I acknowledge that too often the state has represented the interests of
capital, colonialism and masculinity. But the alternative of no state is
worse. </P>

<P>I want to defend government, the role of the state, the concept of elected
officers and their public servants as our servants. I do this at the same
time as I acknowledge the problems of public bureaucracies. I have worked
directly for ministers, and in the public service. So, I have a healthy
scepticism about the way governments work. </P>

<P>We have seen, heard and read a zillion vituperative critiques of central
government and state intervention. Arguments against the state have been
used by the new right to destroy some of the infrastructure I believe we
desperately still need. I want to put the other side and argue that we
need to reform rather than discard the interventionist state. </P>

<P>Debates on the relative merits of state intervention versus individual
freedom almost always result in more power for the powerful. So those with
least power cannot use their 'freedoms'. But the power gap is neither the
whole story, nor the most important issue. </P>

<P>Market forces, and the notion of providing for customers rather than
citizens, will not improve the relative power positions one whit. The need
to mitigate power is why the modern state came into being. It was a product
of colonial trade and the industrial revolution in Europe. </P>

<P>The growth of trade, industrial cities and manufacturing outside the
home/farm base required the regulation of commercial transactions. Later,
in the nineteenth century, social legislation was introduced, often against
considerable opposition. </P>

<P>These reforms in factories, education and public health may have been
because of a need for more skilled and productive workers. Or they may
have been a direct response to the inhumanity of uncontrolled market forces,
greed and self interest. None of the reforms resulted from governments
plotting to undermine the autonomy of families or communities. It was the
condition of the people which required urgent attention. </P>

<P>The state assumed responsibility for some social services, the regulation
of some social behaviour and limited power to redistribute resources. Government
therefore became significant in developing social cohesion through providing
citizens with public education, health care and other public services.
Universal access replaced the many scattered and often inadequate informal
service provisions. </P>

<P>Education, health care, working conditions, child welfare, pensions,
child care, divorce and other forms of social legislation have increasingly
become part of the public agenda. We can thank the 'votes for women' campaigns
for initiating some of the changes. While some of their proposals were
moral policing of the 'lower orders', others provided the base for more
recent feminist demands. </P>

<P>Some ill informed, nostalgia merchants claim that the care offered in
families and communities was undermined by government. This fiction ignores
the fact that care only existed as part of reciprocal feudal and familial
obligations. This system was dependent on rural land ownership and was
terminally weakened by urbanisation. </P>

<P>The mass of strangers in factories in the new cities did not have reciprocal
bonds and mutual obligations. So the State reluctantly became the provider
of services and support. These social services then became essential to
maintain people's sense of belonging and helped to enforce the obligations
of citizenship. They were part of social harmony and cohesion. </P>

<P>Giving to those we care for is easy because we recognise our common
humanity. Giving to those who we do not know with the same willingness
is harder because it requires our acknowledgment that strangers are like
us and entitled to our care. This was the policy view of English sociologist
Richard Titmus, and his justification for the welfare state in the post
war period. Titmus' comments were made at a time when the roles for the
public sector and aspects of state intervention, went well beyond the simple
regulation of transactions and the protection of property in the minimal
state. </P>

<P>The stimulus for the establishment of the modern welfare state was the
rise of fascism and communism in the depression of the 1930s. Europe, America
and Australia had shown signs of social disintegration as the veterans
from the war joined private armies to protest against unemployment and
poverty. </P>

<P>The seeds of fascism fell on some very fertile ground. While Germany
stands out as the worst example of totalitarianism, there were fascist-type
militias and parties in many countries. </P>

<P>What Nazism showed, in a particularly brutal way, was the banality of
evil and the ordinariness of the people involved. The holocaust/shoah was
a systematic destruction on the basis of race only, and was supported by
many ordinary people who believed the propaganda. </P>

<P>The lessons learned from the rise of Nazism and its control over the
people, made the victors of the Second World War concerned not to repeat
the errors of the twenties and thirties. The welfare state, Western Governments
believed, would prevent 'it' ever happening again. </P>

<P>The peace plans after the Second World War were not just there because
of the lobbying of reformers, but because the power brokers saw sense in
providing both a welfare state and Keynesian counter cyclical government
spending to avoid unemployment. </P>

<P>Yet by the 1970s the welfare state was being questioned and much of
the eighties saw it being undermined by radical right wing reform. The
Anglophone countries led the debate on limiting the role of the state,
and shifting services from the public to the market sector. The UK and
USA have unbundled some of the more 'civilised' aspects of the modern state
and replaced them with competitive tooth and claw. </P>

<P>Was the post war concept of the state and public sector flawed? Has
the welfare state passed its use-by date? Or has it been undermined quite
deliberately by certain self interested groups, including media magnates,
who want to cut state spending to reduce their possible tax obligations?
</P>

<P>What is happening now, fifty years later, offers some uncomfortable
similarities to the politics of the 30s. Nationalism, tribalism, and other
elements of communal conflict are increasing. So we need to look at how
intervention can be used to underscore our common humanity and the idiocy
of civil conflict. </P>

<P>Why is the interventionist approach relevant today? For one, it worked.
Those countries which had good welfare systems have also had relatively
peaceful and cohesive years of post war growth. </P>

<P>If we do not learn from history, we are compelled to repeat the errors.
If we continue to undermine the role of government as a benign and universal
provider - however inefficient - then we are asking for trouble. </P>

<P>The changes I hope to see would involve the productive interplay of
state and community, because it is in this interplay that we can create
a truly civil society. The state needs to be part of creating tolerable
social structures which are capable of reinventing themselves as open,
egalitarian and democratic. Therefore, logically, we need to establish
the political frameworks which encourage good citizenship but do not impose
them by fiat or by leaving a vacuum. </P>

<P>Central governments and the public sector have had, without significant
participation by women, a considerable, albeit sometimes reluctant role,
in creating social programs . Carole Pateman, a political philosopher,
claims the modern state was initially a sexual contract to protect masculine
power and property. </P>

<P>The state's social roles, which could be seen as the more feminised
interests, have gradually increased over the past 200 years and have delivered
benefits to many of the less powerful, as well as the more powerful. </P>

<P>The advantages of central action are illustrated by the Equal Pay case
in Australia. A court set up unequal minimum pay rates, but changed these
to equal rates over half a century later. Our centralised wage fixing system
has closed the gaps between high and low income earners while collective
bargaining in other countries has seen more unequal wage outcomes. These
advantages are now under threat. </P>

<P>Feminists have influenced, and can continue to, influence the state.
Even though I am more optimistic than Pateman, I recognise that all is
not rosy with governments and their concerns. I would be the first to claim
there is still too wide a public private split, which means that many of
the concerns of women are still not seen as legitimate or serious. These
concerns involve men but are, for some obscure reason, left to women to
raise, for example male violence and maintenance of children. </P>

<P>However, there have been sufficient reforms over the past decades for
us to see that the state is the best hope for positive change. If we can
use the power of state structures to contain the powerful, then we can
develop the trust levels that comes from a just society. The taxation literature
on compliance indicates that the willing payment of taxes depends on taxes
being seen as fair - rather than on the actual rates. </P>

<P>Any discussion on the institutions of government must include the dimensions
of power, as well as its use and abuse. I realise that there are problems
with top down duress, as well as bottom up parochialism, but it is democratic
centralised power that gives the outgroups their best chances of ensuring
their needs are not overlooked. </P>

<P>The experiences of feminism over the last few decades has shown us that
it is only when government acts, that issues such as discrimination, violence
in the home and child care services move into the areas of public concern,
rather than just being seen as sectional interests. </P>

<P>There would be limited assistance for sole parents, had there not been
a Federal Government prepared to act. Even when one state has been innovative,
such as with child endowment and widow's pensions, it has only been when
the Commonwealth took over, that residents in other states have received
payments as well. Human rights laws and Federal legislation have given
powers to Aboriginal groups that the states have denied them. </P>

<P>I have been involved in the long fight for child care. This program
has required a constant move from Federal to State and vice versa as community
groups sought to put children on the agenda. Finally a Federal program
has been established and expanded. </P>

<P>We have examples of State governments showing themselves to be limited
in their views such as the Tasmanian laws on homosexuality. Changing these
laws involved both the Commonwealth Government and the United Nations.
</P>

<P>There are many other examples of when the Commonwealth has been more
enlightened because distance from local prejudice has sometimes allowed
it to pick up the new and the possibly controversial. Feminists and other
lobbyists play off the different levels of Government to gain advantage
for the less powerful. </P>

<P>The success of these tactics confirms my belief that once the local
process has been exhausted, and the problem still remains, we need to be
able to go further up and out to seek support. Issues of equity and rights
can be escalated past the local level which may be bogged down by the familiar,
and so the problems cannot be dealt with at a conceptual distance. Attitudes
on race in small towns is a clear example of this. I suspect that being
further from the coalface may sometimes make the less politically popular
decisions easier. </P>

<P>There are claims in Australia that we are over-governed and that we
place too much reliance on Government. There are those who want to abolish
the States and those who are always suspicious of the Commonwealth. However,
as an activist over the past two decades, I am happy to see what we have
remain and even if it stays a little confused and overlapping. </P>

<P>The demonising of state and public power ignores the possibilities of
using these powers to mediate and control the powerful. So I am implacably
opposed to recreating government as a minimalist option which operates
only as a provider of last resort, caring only for those who cannot care
for themselves. </P>

<P>A smaller government puts at risk all those areas of concern which do
not lend themselves to market solutions. There has never been much business
interest in providing help or services to those who have little ability
to pay, or in protecting those who cannot afford to buy their own safety.
</P>

<P>There is increasing evidence that the more competition takes over from
intervention, the more inequalities increase. It is inequality rather than
poverty that destroys the social capital, because unfairness creates crises
of belief in political systems. </P>

<P>These crises are double edged. The poor who are excluded resent those
they see as gaining unfair advantage because of their resources. The well
off who pay taxes are likely to see the provision of public services or
money only to those who are labelled poor as unfair or overgenerous. </P>

<P>The issues of maldistributed power are exacerbated by market forces
increasing inequality. The idea that market providers can be regulated
to comply with ethical standards ignores the difficulties that governments
have in regulating the powerful. </P>

<P>There is a self destruct button being pushed by some central governments.
They are trying to redefine their role as steering, not rowing. Yet the
same time, their legitimacy is under question by the electorates. Instead
of proving their value by visibly providing indications of their existence,
many governments are reducing their roles, their functions and their assets.
</P>

<P>Public sectors are, and have been contracting, at least in the English
speaking countries. As Australia already has one of the smallest public
sectors, further cuts can only create more problems. Our fiscal anorexia
may do serious harm. On the other hand, because we have the smallest public
sector in the OECD and the lowest tax bill, we do have plenty of room to
move up and increase our 'common wealth'. </P>

<P>In Hannah Arendt's schema of the human condition, there is recognition
that the nation state and the community have supplanted the family in many
of its tasks. The education system has taken over from parents, the health
care system has replaced home medicine and our daily reproductive processes
are now publicly supported. </P>

<P>Take away the public services, and many people will feel a clear sense
of desertion and loss. Fragile forms of private life try to make do on
their own resources. Selling off publicly owned assets is also a problem.
In the eyes of some citizens, probably poorer ones, public ownership is
part of the 'family silver'. Losing these assets is seen as a loss of stability,
of our common wealth. The change of public utilities to business enterprises,
with user pays costing, is again seen as a loss of public service. </P>

<P>Moves towards reducing government activities ignore the effects that
selling off public resources may have on social capital. Arendt uses the
image of many families seeing themselves as owners of the nation state.
As citizens, they see public services and public ownership of resources
as extensions of their personal property to which they have the right of
access. </P>

<P>Surveys show the public rejects privatisation. In the same vein, there
are also signs that people are prepared to pay more taxes in return for
the services they expect from government, despite an almost incessant media
campaign against raising taxes. </P>

<P>There are other problems with equating customer and citizen. What we
receive from government is paid for by us through taxes, so there is a
sense of entitlement which is undermined when some services are targeted
only to the poor. Those not entitled to benefits tend to question the rights
of recipients and so we return to judging who is worthy of receiving public
assistance. </P>

<P>Many taxpayers also expect to have access to government services and
do not want to see need defined just in financial terms. They believe that
those who pay their taxes are also entitled to government support. Allocating
services and resources only to the poor, creates divisions among citizens.
</P>

<P>In a good public sector service, there should be a mutual desire to
see needs met and problems solved. In a commercial transaction, the satisfaction
of the customer is driven by the profit margin and not by customer need.
When public services are contracted out, the compliance is to the contractor
not the client. </P>

<P>Users of contracted out services have no sense of entitlement and ownership.
We have different expectations of public and commercial services. Public
services are seen as entitlements and part of the obligations of the state
to its citizens. We form different relationships with voluntary associations
and with commercial enterprises. </P>

<P>If we lose the social capital which the expanded role of the state has
provided, with its implicit and explicit concepts of citizen rights and
mutual obligations, there will be serious consequences. </P>

<P>It is ironic that the private sector is increasingly aping the idea
of citizenship. New marketing strategies are focusing on creating customer
loyalty through clubs and points gained. Marketeers are smarter than public
choice theorists in recognising the intangibles which are part of social
capital. </P>

<P>The use of sponsorship by corporations is a growing phenomenon as they
try to create a form of corporate citizenship. However, a burst of <I>Rotary</I>,
or funding with an eye to photo opportunities, are not alternatives or
replacements for civic culture. </P>

<P>Business purchasing sports for TV threatens local sporting clubs. These
clubs are a classic part of civic cultures and offer opportunities for
local meetings, yet they are being supplanted or bought by brands looking
for the cachet of voluntary organisations. </P>

<P>So business moves towards the associational model, and government moves
towards naked markets. </P>

<P>The other side of sponsorship is the loss of status by government when
it seeks commercial sponsors for what are seen as essential services or
national treasures. The owner of the rescue helicopter is a bank, the opera
is <I>Esso</I>. Cereal makers support nutrition education to enhance their
influence and profits. Art prizes are sponsored and so on. No wonder people
are confused as to who owns the country! </P>

<P>It is no surprise that we have lost social cohesion. People are expressing
an unrealistic fear of crime. Sales of home security devices are increasing.
There is more cynicism about government and industry leaders, and generally
less faith in people's ability to be decent human beings. </P>

<P>The image of government services as providers of last resort does not
improve their legitimacy. As the visible face of government disappears,
with fewer services provided directly there is a danger that people will
stop identifying any function with government. </P>

<P>So how do we create social cohesion? We need to increase the functions
and visibility of governments. We need specific cultures of civic concern
- of mutual responsibility - and resources for social capital formation.
We need stepped levels of government, the ability to appeal to a higher
authority when the lower level fails to connect with a wider agenda. These
levels provide the fora for good decisions. </P>

<P>Multi-level decision-making can form a web of broad trust relationships
which are part of our social capital - and the web needs to stretch all
the way from the family to the national government and supra-national structures.
</P>

<P>When we become part of public life, we become more human. This is the
vita activa - or 'political life' - which Hannah Arendt names as one of
three components of the Human Condition. This concept of citizenship can
operate in a formalised framework of state power, as well as in less formal
voluntaristic groups. It recognises that responsibilities go with rights
and that, in the final analysis, we have to own the governments to whom
we entrust power. </P>

<P>We work best when we make decisions collectively, by drawing on each
other's experience and by debating different views. The solo decision maker
is not, one might say, the full human bottle! </P>

<P>Next week the need for dissent, even from my views! </P>
