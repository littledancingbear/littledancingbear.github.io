<P>
<HR>
</P>

<P><B>Mr. ACTING SPEAKER:</B></P>

<P>Before I call the honourable member for Oxley, I remind the House that
this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend
to her the usual courtesies. </P>

<P><B>Ms HANSON:</B></P>

<P>Mr. Acting Speaker, in making my first speech in this place, I congratulate
you on your election and wish to say how proud I am to be here as the Independent
member for Oxley. I come here not as a polished politician but as a woman
who has had her fair share of life's knocks. My view on issues is based
on common-sense, and my experience as a mother of four children, as a sole
parent, and as a business-woman running a fish and chip shop. I won the
seat of Oxley largely on an issue that has resulted in me being called
a racist. That issue related to my comment that Aboriginals received more
benefits than non-Aboriginals. </P>

<P>The Howard government must become visionary and be prepared to act,
even at the risk of making mistakes. In this financial year we will be
spending at least $1.5 billion on foreign aid and we cannot be sure that
this money will be properly spent, as corruption and mismanagement in many
of the recipient countries are legend. </P>

<P>We now have a situation where a type of reverse racism is applied to
mainstream Australians by those who promote political correctness and those
who control the various taxpayer funded 'industries' that flourish in our
society servicing Aboriginals, multi-culturalists and a host of other minority
groups. In response to my call for equality for all Australians, the most
noisy criticism came from the fat cats, bureaucrats and the do-gooders.
They screamed the loudest because they stand to lose the most - their power,
money and position, all funded by ordinary Australian taxpayers. </P>

<P>Present governments are encouraging separatism in Australia by providing
opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only to Aboriginals.
Along with millions of Australians, I am fed up to the back teeth with
the inequalities that are being promoted by the government and paid for
by the taxpayer under the assumption that Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged
people in Australia. I do not believe that the colour of one's skin determines
whether you are disadvantaged. As Paul Hasluck said in parliament in October
1955 when he was Minister for Territories: </P>

<UL>
<P>The distinction I make is this. A social problem is one that concerns
the way in which people live together in one society. A racial problem
is a problem which confronts two different races who live in two separate
societies, even if those societies are side by side. We do not want a society
in Australia in which one group enjoys one set of privileges and another
group enjoys another set of privileges. </P>
</UL>

<P>Hasluck's vision was of a single society in which racial emphases were
rejected and social issues addressed. I totally agree with him, and so
would the majority of Australians. </P>

<P>But, remember, when he gave his speech he was talking about the privileges
that white Australians were seen to be enjoying over Aboriginals. Today,
41 years later, I talk about the exact opposite - the privileges Aboriginals
enjoy over other Australians. I have done research on benefits available
only to Aboriginals and challenge anyone to tell me how Aboriginals are
disadvantaged when they can obtain three and five per cent housing loans
denied to non-Aboriginals. </P>

<P>This nation is being divided into black and white, and the present system
encourages this. I am fed up with being told, 'This is our land.' Well,
where the hell do I go? I was born here, and so were my parents and children.
</P>

<P>I will work beside anyone and they will be my equal but I draw the line
when told I must pay and continue paying for something that happened over
200 years ago. Like most Australians, I worked for my land; no-one gave
it to me. </P>

<P>Apart from the $40 million spent so far since Mabo on native title claims,
the government has made available $1 billion for Aboriginals and Torres
Strait Islanders as compensation for land they cannot claim under native
title. Bear in mind that the $40 million spent so far in native title has
gone into the pockets of grateful lawyers and consultants. Not one native
title has been granted as I speak. </P>

<P>The majority of Aboriginals do not want handouts because they realise
that welfare is killing them. This quote says it all: 'If you give a man
a fish you feed him for a day. If you teach him how to fish you feed him
for a lifetime.' </P>

<P>Those who feed off the Aboriginal industry do not want to see things
changed. Look at the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Members receive
$290 a day sitting allowance and $320 a day travelling allowance, and most
of these people also hold other very well paid positions. No wonder they
did not want to resign recently! </P>

<P>Reconciliation is everyone recognising and treating each other as equals,
and everyone must be responsible for their own actions. This is why I am
calling for ATSIC to be abolished. It is a failed, hypocritical and discriminatory
organisation that has failed dismally the people it was meant to serve.
It will take more than Senator Herron's surgical skills to correct the
terminal mess it is in. Anyone with a criminal record can, and does, hold
a position with ATSIC. I cannot hold my position as a politician if I have
a criminal record - once again, two sets of rules. </P>

<P>If politicians continue to promote separatism in Australia, they should
not continue to hold their seats in this parliament. They are not truly
representing all Australians, and I call on the people to throw them out.
To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people,
one nation, one flag. </P>

<P>The greatest cause of family breakdown is unemployment. This country
of ours has the richest mineral deposits in the world and vast rich lands
for agriculture and is surrounded by oceans that provide a wealth of seafood,
yet we are $190 billion in debt with an interest bill that is strangling
us. </P>

<P>Youth unemployment between the ages of 15 to 24 runs at 25 per cent
and is even higher in my electorate of Oxley. Statistics, by cooking the
books, say that Australia's unemployment is at 8.6 per cent, or just under
one million people. If we disregard that one hour's work a week classifies
a person as employed, then the figure is really between 1.5 million and
1.9 million unemployed. This is a crisis that recent governments have ignored
because of a lack of will. We are regarded as a Third World with First
World living conditions. We have one of the highest interest rates in the
world, and we owe more money per capita than any other country. All we
need is a nail hole in the bottom of the boat and we're sunk. </P>

<P>In real dollar terms, our standard of living has dropped over the past
10 years. In the 1960s, our wages increase ran at three per cent and unemployment
at two per cent. Today, not only is there no wage increase, we have gone
backwards and unemployment is officially 8.6 per cent. The real figure
must be close to 12 to 13 per cent. </P>

<P>I wish to comment briefly on some social and legal problems encountered
by many of my constituents - problems not restricted to just my electorate
of Oxley. I refer to the social and family upheaval created by the Family
Law Act and the ramifications of that act embodied in the child support
scheme. The Family Law Act, which was the child of the disgraceful Senator
Lionel Murphy, should be repealed. It has brought death, misery and heartache
to countless thousands of Australians. Children are treated like pawns
in some crazy game of chess. </P>

<P>The child support scheme has become unworkable, very unfair and one
sided. Custodial parents can often profit handsomely at the expense of
a parent paying child support, and in many cases the non-custodial parent
simply gives up employment to escape the, in many cases, heavy and punitive
financial demands. Governments must give to all those who have hit life's
hurdles the chance to rebuild and have a future. </P>

<P>We have lost all our big Australian industries and icons, including
Qantas when it sold 25 per cent of its shares and a controlling interest
to British Airways. Now this government wants to sell Telstra, a company
that made a $1.2 billion profit last year and will make a $2 billion profit
this year. But, first, they want to sack 54,000 employees to show better
profits and share prices. Anyone with business sense knows that you do
not sell off your assets especially when they are making money. I may be
only 'a fish and chip shop lady,' but some of these economists need to
get their heads out of the textbooks and get a job in the real world. </P>

<P>I would not even let one of them handle my grocery shopping. </P>

<P>Immigration and multiculturalism are issues that this government is
trying to address, but for far too long ordinary Australians have been
kept out of any debate by the major parties. </P>

<P>I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed
and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being
swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming
into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and
religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate. </P>

<P>Of course, I will be called racist but, if I can invite whom I want
into my home, then I should have the right to have a say in who comes into
my country. A truly multicultural country can never be strong or united.
The world is full of failed and tragic examples, ranging from Ireland to
Bosnia to Africa and, closer to home, Papua New Guinea. America and Great
Britain are currently paying the price. </P>

<P>Arthur Calwell was a great Australian and Labor leader, and it is a
pity that there are not men of his stature sitting on the opposition benches
today. Arthur Calwell said: </P>

<UL>
<P>Japan, India, Burma, Ceylon and every new African nation are fiercely
anti-white and anti one another. Do we want or need any of these people
here? I am one red-blooded Australian who says no and who speaks for 90%
of Australians. </P>
</UL>

<P>I have no hesitation in echoing the words of Arthur Calwell. </P>

<P>There is light at the end of the tunnel and there are solutions. If
this government wants to be fair dinkum, then it must stop kowtowing to
financial markets, international organisations, world bankers, investment
companies and big business people. </P>

<P>The Howard government must become visionary and be prepared to act,
even at the risk of making mistakes. In this financial year we will be
spending at least $1.5 billion on foreign aid and we cannot be sure that
this money will be properly spent, as corruption and mismanagement in many
of the recipient countries are legend. </P>

<P>Australia must review its membership and funding of the UN, as it is
a little like ATSIC on a grander scale, with huge tax-free, American-dollar
salaries, duty-free luxury cars and diplomatic status. The World Health
Organisation has a lot of its medical experts sitting in Geneva while hospitals
in Africa have no drugs and desperate patients are forced to seek medication
on the black market. I am going to find out how many treaties we have signed
with the UN, have them exposed and then call for their repudiation. </P>

<P>The government should cease all foreign aid immediately and apply the
savings to generate employment here at home. </P>

<P>Abolishing the policy of multiculturalism will save billions of dollars
and allow those from ethnic backgrounds to join mainstream Australia, paving
the way to a strong, united country. Immigration must be halted in the
short term so that our dole queues are not added to by, in many cases,
unskilled migrants not fluent in the English language. </P>

<P>This would be one positive step to rescue many young and older Australians
from a predicament which has become a national disgrace and crisis. I must
stress at this stage that I do not consider those people from ethnic backgrounds
currently living in Australia anything but first-class citizens, provided
of course that they give this country their full, undivided loyalty. </P>

<P>The government must be imaginative enough to become involved, in the
short term at least, in job-creating projects that will help establish
the foundation for a resurgence of national development and enterprise.
</P>

<P>Such schemes would be the building of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway
line, new roads and ports, water conservation, reforestation and other
sensible and practical environmental projects. </P>

<P>Therefore I call for the introduction of national service for a period
of 12 months, compulsory for males and females upon finishing year 12 or
reaching 18 years of age. This could be a civil service with a touch of
military training, because I do not feel we can go on living in a dream
world forever and a day believing that war will never touch our lives again.
</P>

<P>The government must do all it can to help reduce interest rates for
business. How can we compete with Japan, Germany and Singapore, which enjoy
rates of two per cent, 5.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively? Reduced
tariffs on foreign goods that compete with local products seem only to
cost Australians their jobs. </P>

<P>We must look after our own before lining the pockets of overseas countries
and investors at the expense of our living standards and future. </P>

<P>Time is running out. We may have only 10 to 15 years left to turn things
around. Because of our resources and our position in the world, we will
not have a say because neighbouring countries such as Japan, with 125 million
people; China, with 1.2 billion people; India, with 846 million people;
Indonesia, with 178 million people; and Malaysia, with 20 million people
are well aware of our resources and potential. Wake up, Australia, before
it is too late. </P>

<P>Australians need and want leaders who can inspire and give hope in difficult
times. Now is the time for the Howard government to accept the challenge.
Everything I have said is relevant to my electorate of Oxley, which is
typical of mainstream Australia. </P>

<P>I do have concerns for my country and I am going to do my best to speak
my mind and stand up for what I believe in. As an Independent I am confident
that I can look after the needs of the people of Oxley and I will always
be guided by their advice. It is refreshing to be able to express my views
without having to toe a party line. </P>

<P>It has got me into trouble on the odd occasion, but I am not going to
stop saying what I think. I consider myself just an ordinary Australian
who wants to keep this great country strong and independent, and my greatest
desire is to see all Australians treat each other as equals as we travel
together towards the new century. </P>

<P>I will fight hard to keep my seat in this place, but that will depend
on the people who sent me here. </P>

<P>Mr. Acting Speaker, I thank you for your attention and trust that you
will not think me presumptuous if I dedicate this speech to the people
of Oxley and those Australians who have supported me. I salute them all.
