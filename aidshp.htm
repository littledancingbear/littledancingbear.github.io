<font size="4">Summary </font>

<p>
<font size="2">
As the AIDS epidemic continues to expand and as there is no substantial
hope for curative treatment, prevention keeps the only tool to cope with
the threat of HIV transmission and AIDS. This article presents a conceptual
framework and detailed guidelines for the planning, implementation and
evaluation of AIDS health promotion for youth. The framework focuses on
basic principles of health promotion and refers to the living conditions
and lifestyles of youth being of relevance for the development of gender
roles and sexual behavior. Community organization plays a crucial role
for AIDS health promotion for youth. Only comprehensive approaches taking
account of social and cultural conditions present an adequate arena for
successful AIDS health promotion. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The global epidemic of HIV infection remains dynamic and is continuing
to expand (Mann et al. 1992, Smallman-Raynor et al. 1992). At the beginning
of the 1980's only about 100.000 persons worldwide were infected with HIV.
Since then, more than 13 million men, women and children have become infected.
This cumulative total included more than 1 million persons who were infected
with HIV during the first 6 months of 1992 alone. Nearly two thirds of
these live in Sub-Saharan Africa, 20% in the Americas, and about 15% in
Europe, Asia and Oceania. In 1992, the World Health Organization estimated
the actual cumulative global total of AIDS cases at over one million people.
</p>

<p>AIDS constitutes a worldwide problem of major proportions, affecting
developed and developing countries. Until the end of this decade, about
three times more HIV infections will occur than had occurred during the
1980s. The vast majority of new HIV infections would be preventable by
globally and nationally coordinated efforts. When the AIDS epidemic was
first recognized, a high prevalence of HIV infection was found among specific
groups: homosexual and bisexual men, users of injectable drugs, and hemophiliacs.
Nowadays, it is no longer appropriate to focus on <i>high risk groups</i>,
as the epidemic has contaminated all kinds of population groups. Prevention
programmes have to concentrate on<i> high-risk behaviors</i> instead, that
is on behaviors that expose people to infection. </p>

<p>Although AIDS has been a major issue of public debate nearly everywhere
it is still rather difficult to talk about AIDS and HIV transmission without
evoking emotional concern. However, a majority of people worldwide - especially
adolescents and youth - do not perceive themselves as being threatened
by HIV transmission but feel others are, due to different sexual preferences
or certain risk-taking. <i>Blaming the victim</i> is a strategy which individuals
and groups frequently choose so that they need not consider their own lifestyles.
</p>

<p>Three modes of transmission of HIV infection have been documented
so far: </p>

<ul>
<li>unprotected sexual intercourse (<i>unsafe sex</i>) between men and
women or between men and men when one of the partners is infected with
the virus; </li>

<li>injection (during self-injecting drug abuse through needle-sharing
of contaminated syringes and needles; through unsterilized instruments
for scarification or tattooing) or by transfusion of HIV infected blood
or blood products; </li>

<li>pregnancy, i.e. from an infected mother to her infant. </li>
</ul>

<p>Sexual transmission seems to remain the major mode of HIV infection,
and in this context heterosexual transmission is increasing rapidly - especially
with regard to developing countries. </p>

<p>At least half of those infected with HIV worldwide are under the
age of 25. As many of them are likely to have acquired their HIV infection
before the age of 18, AIDS is also a major concern affecting youth in every
country. Adolescence, the developmental period between 10 to 19 years,
and youth as the stage between 15 to 24 years are periods of profound physiological,
psychological, and social change. They are also periods of time particularly
related to behavioral experimentation in many aspects of everyday life,
including sexuality and drug abuse. </p>

<p>Sexual intercourse between adolescents may bring about a potential
risk of HIV infection. In many countries, a large number of adolescents
do not protect themselves and their partners in case of intercourse. Sexually
active young men and women often change partners before they establish
a family or long-term relationships. Experimentation with illegal drugs
may expose other young people to hazardous intravenous drug abuse. </p>

<p>In many countries, schools are a common focus of educational activities.
A large number of young people throughout the world attend school or are
in contact with those who do. There is a general trend towards more health
education in school, including sexual and reproductive health, family planning
and HIV/AIDS prevention. However, in many countries, sexual issues - if
taught at all - are delivered in a highly constrained and only in a biological
manner. Very often, even family-life educators will also exclude sensitive
topics of adolescent sexuality. </p>

<p>For young people who have left school or never had the opportunity
to visit one, the situation is frequently bleak. They have only limited
access to counselling, diagnostic and treatment services of reproductive
health - or, as in many countries, this is even prohibited by law, particularly
with regard to youth . Thus, there is a growing need for HIV/AIDS education
and outreach programmes that support adolescents and youth outside the
school system. </p>

<p>The prevention of HIV transmission has become one of the most important
elements in the work of WHO and many other organizations. As no medical
cure will be available for AIDS in the near future and as no vaccine is
available to prevent HIV transmission, a psychosocial approach to prevention,
i.e., AIDS health promotion, seems to be of utmost importance. </p>

<h2>Lifestyles conducive to health in the context of health promotion
</h2>

<p>The World Health Organization (1990a) has published <i>A</i> <i>Call
for Action. Promoting Health in Developing Countries,</i> in which three
principal strategies for health promotion are outlined: </p>

<ul>
<li>Advocacy of policies </li>

<li>Developing strong alliances and social support systems </li>

<li>Empowering people </li>
</ul>

<p>Those being concerned with public health have always been strong
advocates of policies aiming at the improvement of health conditions. Advocacy
for health is <i>first of all</i> advocacy for education in every aspect
and aiming at every person regardless of age, gender, social status or
religious belief. Thus, health promotion programmes are designed to collaborate
closely with the formal and informal educational system. </p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, advocacy for health is health-related political
action aiming at local, regional, and national politicians and political
organizations. It is social lobbying for the health needs of the people.
</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, advocacy for health is the struggle for adequate
resource allocation within existing local, regional, and national budgets
regarding health needs of the communities. In some cases, it will be the
development of health promotion budgets, in others it will be the shifting
of resources from one budget to the other. We have to be prepared that
health promotion - usually a rather weak player in the money game - has
to strengthen its capacities if it will succeed. </p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, advocacy for health is taking legal rights already
existing into action. It is surprising that in many countries, neither
politicians and governments nor non-governmental organizations and social
groups are aware that the improvement of living conditions and lifestyles
conducive to health has been made a legal right - if only by becoming a
Member of the United Nations. The Declaration of Human Rights, for example,
is legally binding for all Member States of the UN. In the Declaration
and its connected laws, the protection of minorities, equality between
females and males, access to education and health care are considered to
be human rights. Many countries have nationally binding laws regarding
these topics. Thus, there is a good starting point for health promotion
advocacy. </p>

<p>We will now turn to the development of strong alliances and social
support systems. Health promotion, by its definition, is related to several
other sectors of society. Health may be promoted everywhere because almost
each social sector contributes to health conditions. But it is also true
that intersectoral collaboration is difficult to implement, since each
sector follows its own sectoral objectives and policies. Nevertheless,
the development of strong alliances with other social sectors than health
is a priority of health promotion programmes. </p>

<p>Social support systems, on the other side, refer to the circumstances
in which people live. Neighbours, relatives, friends, colleagues, and the
family itself are elements of the support systems. Human beings live in
networks of social relations. Health promotion has to address these networks
in order to reach the individual and if it reaches the individual it will
have access to her/his social support systems. There is a constant interplay
between the individual and the networks she/is is part of. It is a formidable
task of health promotion to get in touch with these systems, to enable
the people to strengthen and change their relations with regard to health
promotion issues, and to give support to the individual and her/his social
groups in order to attain lifestyles conducive to health. We understand
that building strong alliances and social support systems refers to community
organization, which is seen as a key method of health promotion (Minkler
1991, Alinsky 1969). </p>

<p>Finally, we turn to the strategy of empowering people with attitudes,
knowledge and skills enabling them to develop lifesytles conducive to health.
This seems to be the traditional area of health education, covering formal
and informal education related to health. As this is true, we feel however,
that the scope of the strategy is somewhat wider. </p>

<p>All of us would like to find some simple things people can do to
improve their health. Of course, there are some: many issues that have
been taught by health educators during the past, sometimes successfully,
however rather frequently not successfully at all. As social, cultural,
environmental, economic and political conditions have become more complex
and complicated in these days, simple things may be an adequate answer
no more. We understand that empowerment refers to the capability of the
people to share their views on health conditions with their fellow-neighbours
and to recognise that they may have some of the difficulties in common.
Common problems may lead to communities of people becoming enabled to solve
their problems commonly. This is what empowerment means: enabling people
to organise themselves as a community taking care of their living conditions
and commonly striving for lifestyles conducive to health. </p>

<p>The new and broader health promotion concept takes a comprehensive
social and ecological model of health and human development as its basis
(Milio 1986, WHO 1986, 1990a). The key-term is <i>lifestyles conducive
to health</i>. </p>

<p>The lifestyles concept draws heavily on sociological and anthropological
knowledge concerning patterns of human action and interaction and their
relation to health (Armstrong 1983, Bateson 1979, Bennett 1976, Berger
&amp; Luckmann 1967, Crawford 1984, Freund 1982, Goffman 1971, Hardesty
1977, Honigman 1973, Polhemus 1978, Strunk 1983). A fundamental difference
is made between <i>collective and individual lifestyles</i>, which can
be defined as follows (Wenzel 1983, 7f): </p>

<ul>
<p>&quot;The lifestyle of a social group characterises the totality
of patterns of meaning and forms of expression which are produced by a
group in the course of collective efforts to cope with the demands and
contradictions of the social structures and situations common to all members
of that group. The lifestyle brings together efforts related to the demands
made, i.e. the external (social, political, economic and cultural) conditions
and efforts related to the subjective situation and condition. In the lifestyle
is expressed under what conditions a social group acts or reacts in a particular
way, i.e. the lifestyle tells us in which directions a group tends to develop
its behavior in the ongoing process of coping with the conditions in which
they live. These tendencies, in the forms of common social values, norms,
language forms, interaction rituals etc., provide a reservoir for individuals
or subgroups which they can draw on for their personal and social identity;
it makes it possible for them to give some sense and meaning to their specific
situation. </p>

<p>The lifestyle of an individual characterises the totality of normative
behavioral structures which is developed in the course of his or her life
in the ongoing interaction with his or her social and natural environment.
Subjective motivation and also potential action are expressed through the
lifestyles and are used by the individual according to social situations.
The individual's lifestyle contains variations, additions to and omissions
from the collective lifestyle which are specific to that individual's personality;
nevertheless the individual remains linked to his particular social group
- i.e. any change in his or her lifestyle is bound by the collectively
developed framework - unless, with this change, there is also a change
of the social group, or it is the group which wishes to undergo such a
change. </p>

<p>This concept of lifestyles creates a close link between the living
conditions of an individual, his activities and socially formed strategies
for coping with life. Characteristic for this is the linking of individual
and collective lifestyles in relation to the particular socio-structural
conditions in which the individual lives. Individual behavior is understood
as being largely socially determined - with the implication, among others,
that to change it, social changes are necessary. Thus the message for health
promotion and health education is that integrative strategies for prevention
and intervention must be developed - strategies whose chief characteristic
is that they link up the various social sectors and are also effective
within them.&quot; </p>
</ul>

<p>The basic concept underlying the lifestyles approach is one of socialization
of individuals and social groups and social interaction. Health-related
behaviors of individuals and collectives are viewed as reflections of certain
living conditions and attempts to cope with and/or alter these conditions.
Individual behavior in a social situation is considered an outcome at a
certain point in time of the life-long socialization process; since social
situations change, individual behavior is also always subject to constant
change. </p>

<p>Using this approach, it is possible to study various aspects of health
promotion and of health care, including epidemiological patterns, methods
used in providing clinical care, patient-caregiver interactions, prevention
efforts, etc. </p>

<p>With regard to HIV transmission and AIDS, the lifestyles concept
provides a frame of reference for: </p>

<ul>
<li>studying human behavior and its implications for health in the ecological
context of the community (for example, social epidemiology); </li>

<li>identifying linkages between social, cultural, economic, environmental
and political living conditions and the development of certain individual
and collective lifestyles; </li>

<li>identifying the implications of individual and collective lifestyles
for sexuality and other forms of behavior such as drug use; </li>

<li>identifying the value systems, normative orientations and motivational
patterns of individual and collective lifestyles and their impact on sexual
and other behaviors; and </li>

<li>studying social support systems in the community and their impact
on the development of individual and collective lifestyles conducive to
health. </li>
</ul>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Target areas for health promotion interventions</h2>

<p>In order to specify appropriate approaches to and strategies for
health promotion for the prevention and control of HIV and AIDS, one must
analyse in detail possible target areas for preventive measures. Although
various HIV transmission modes are affected by components of lifestyles,
here we will primarily show how the lifestyles approach can be used to
guide programmes focusing on the primary route of sexual transmission.
</p>

<p>Sexuality can be interpreted as a specific form of bodily interaction
with another person or oneself which is situated in the context of the
participants' lifestyles and living conditions. Any factors impinging on
individual and collective lifestyles accordingly also affect the sexual
behaviors of individuals and social groups. </p>

<p>Sexual intercourse is embedded in a series of social situations in
which persons communicate verbally and/or non-verbally their normative
expectations regarding the interaction process. Usually, this communication
does not include clear statements about having sexual intercourse but rather
culturally- and socially accepted messages which are understood by the
persons as expectations that their relationship will develop into a sexual
one. </p>

<p>The intimate character of sexual relations makes it very difficult
for people to communicate frankly about their sexual expectations and experiences
before they know each other for a longer period of time. Individual sexual
behavior is not a matter of public debate as far as a specific person is
concerned. Although many modes of sexuality are presented publicly in magazines,
books, journals, videos, films and other media, individual sexual preferences
and experiences are usually not presented openly to another person at the
beginning of a (sexual) relationship. </p>

<p>Given the above, it can be useful to distinguish focal points around
which HIV/AIDS related efforts can be developed. We will discuss three
such points - sexuality and concepts of body, gender roles and risk behavior;
it must be noted that others are possible as well (for example, sexuality
and age groups or sexuality and the concept of love). </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Sexuality and concepts of body</h2>

<p>Basically, health promotion aims at the improvement of body development
and behavior as well as to enhance living and working conditions at the
individual and collective levels. The term <i>body</i> used here is based
on anthropological and ecological concepts which assume that the <i>conditions
of human beings</i> comprise physiological, psychological, social and cultural
dimensions. </p>

<p>In many cultures, people tend to perceive themselves and others as
social beings rather than as <i>embodied</i> persons. The body seems to
be a rather difficult issue in social communication except in terms of
illness, disease and sports. However, as Bryan S. Turner states in his
book <i>The body and society</i>: &quot;<i>...human beings are embodied,
just as they are enselved</i>&quot; (Turner 1984, 1), and he continues:
</p>

<ul>
<p>&quot;The body is the most proximate and immediate feature of my
social self, a necessary feature of my social location and of my personal
enselfment and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in
the natural environment.&quot; (Turner 1984, 8). </p>
</ul>

<p>The body is the bearer of the human being and at the same time the
expression of his/her existential, i.e., economic, political, social, cultural
and environmental situation. Individual and social biography are represented
in the body, as are the social and cultural circumstances in which it developed;
moreover, economic and ecological living conditions also find their expression
in the human body. Therefore, body awareness, bodily experiences and bodily
expressions are not only subject to individual choices of lifestyle over
another; they are primarily structured by social communication and interaction,
both of which are dependent upon the symbolic structure of the social system,
i.e., the value system, normative expectations and symbolic categories
such as health, wealth, happiness, satisfaction, power, etc. Relationships
between the individual and collective, between personal and social development,
between economic and ecological processes are both directly sensed and
expressed by the body. </p>

<p>In introducing the concept of the body as a key element in health
promotion, we are referring to the materialistic basis of both health and
disease. All measures taken in this respect have an impact on body awareness,
bodily experiences and bodily expressions. They interfere with bodily communication
and the interaction of individuals and collectives. </p>

<p>There is one aspect of the body which has become more and more relevant
for health promotion: the presentation of the self as a bearer of a specifically-styled
body. Individual and collective strategies for the development of successful
images of the self are pursued in a variety of social and cultural settings.
As Turner (1984, 111) states: <i>&quot;successful images require successful
bodies, which have been trained, disciplined and orchestrated to enhance
our personal value&quot;</i>. The symbolic power of fashion and the associated
trained, styled and altered body are obvious. Practices such as scarification,
tattooing and circumcision are clear examples of this. Turner further adds
(1984, 112): <i>&quot;We jog, slim and sleep not for their intrinsic enjoyment
but to improve our chances at sex, work and longevity.&quot;</i> The body
is thus used as a tool to enhance individual and social attractiveness.
It is not viewed primarily in terms of health but in terms of social, and
thus, sexual relations, too. Health may be a prerequisite, but it is certainly
not the objective of such body management. </p>

<p>Given the above, it can be seen that <i>health</i> may play a minor
role in peoples' body-related thought and actions. The WHO definition of
health focuses on physical, mental and social well-being as indicators
of health. In many cultures, however, well-being seems to be related to
fun, pleasure, relaxation, happiness, productivity, reproduction, etc.,
but not necessarily to<i> health per se</i>. One implication of this may
be utilized regarding HIV/AIDS-related health promotion in the context
of (sexual) relationships: <i>Safe sex</i> promotion might focus on the
message that the person who takes precautions is a more attractive potential
partner. </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Sexuality, reproduction and gender roles</h2>

<p>Gender roles and gender relationships are always subject to change.
This fact is of particular relevance with regard to ways in which people
can protect themselves and others against HIV transmission. For example,
in considering condom use the differences between contraceptive behavior
and protective behavior must be analyzed in order to specify how health
promotion can best approach this topic. </p>

<p>Sexual behavior provides a means for satisfying desire and gaining
pleasure and subsequent relaxation, either alone or with another person.
However, it may also give rise to problems, such as preventing unwanted
pregnancy. </p>

<p>As far as contraception is concerned, communication about its behavioral
implications takes place - if at all - before people decide to have sexual
relations. In particular, contraception is interpreted by men as a female
task: women must take care not to get pregnant. Contraceptive methods such
as the pill and diaphragm are handled by women. There is one other important
implication of contraception: it is frequently interpreted as a medical
approach to preventing unwanted pregnancy and not so much as a social and
psychological means of freeing sexual intercourse from the threat of unwanted
pregnancy. Contraceptive behavior is aimed at avoiding reproduction, not
at preventing certain diseases. </p>

<ul>
<p>With the advent of HIV transmission, the situation has become completely
different. First of all, each act of sexual intercourse carries the risk
of contracting or transmitting the virus as long as no one can be certain
whether he/she already is infected. Therefore, the prevention of transmission
is essential in order to protect oneself and the other person from infection.
In this respect, the prevention of HIV transmission is a complementary
act: I not only protect myself against a certain hazard but also protect
another from getting infected in case I have already contracted the virus.
The responsibility for this preventive measure thus lies not only with
the individual, but also with his/her partner and his/her future partners.
HIV prevention consequently has both individual and collective aspects
(Bateson &amp; Goldsby 1989, 101 ff.). </p>
</ul>

<p>In this context, there is no other decision to be taken than to use
condoms when sexual intercourse takes place. Condom use is exclusively
a male task, i.e., women cannot protect themselves against HIV infection
except by asking men to use condoms or by choosing non-penetrative forms
of sexual contact. In contrast to unwanted pregnancy or sexually-transmitted
diseases, HIV infection cannot be treated medically, i.e., if a person
has contracted the virus, he/she often may have to cope with the subsequent
disease. The threat of HIV transmission thus has consequences for female/male
relations and the balance of power between the sexes. Since the transmission
of HIV infection can only be reduced via condom use, women cannot protect
themselves against it without the collaboration of men. They must depend
on them for protective behavior. As far as contraception is concerned,
women have the possibility to control their reproductive system themselves
in one way or another. Regarding HIV transmission, their bodies are placed
somewhat outside their control. This shift in the balance of power has
effects on female self-esteem and, probably, on women's behavioral intentions
regarding sexuality and sexual behaviors. </p>

<p>While the modes of HIV transmission seem to be rather clear and the
need for preventive measures cannot be neglected, many people seem to have
difficulties in adjusting their behaviors accordingly. </p>

<p>Condom use may be considered in some cultures as a behavior which
does not permit direct bodily interaction; the artificial product <i>condom</i>
is viewed as being contrary to the nature of sexuality. Condoms may be
considered socially as representing a concrete request for sexual intercourse,
i.e., those who have condoms available are suspected of wanting to have
sexual intercourse. The condom becomes a symbol of sexual desire; it makes
the private desire public. Karen Luker (1978) found a similar interpretation
among women concerning the use of diaphragms. Finally, condom use may be
considered as an interference in the behavioral process of sexuality, a
disturbance of the intimacy of the sexual process and an interruption in
the process of satisfying lust and gaining pleasure. </p>

<p>For all these reasons, the content of HIV/AIDS-related health promotion
should again be considered very carefully. Campaigns could focus on changing
social norms so that condom use comes to be viewed as a common, <i>normal</i>
and desirable behavior. The fact that precautionary measures can remove
a cause for worry (that is HIV transmission), thus enhancing feelings of
trust and intimacy, could be an advantageous message. </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Risk behavior</h2>

<p>Individuals and groups develop behavioral patterns and strategies
which help them to cope with the requirements and contradictions inherent
in their ecological and economic living conditions. These not only involve
health-promotive behaviors; people also practice health-hazardous behaviors
for different reasons. Within the framework of the lifestyles approach,
the concept of risk behavior has been used to reflect upon those living
conditions and social situations in which people might carry out certain
behaviors for a specific period of time which can be considered by others
as health-hazardous; however, the individuals involved may not feel the
hazards are important as long as the positive effects of the behaviors
are qualified as superior, both individually and collectively. This is
certainly true with regard to specific sexual behaviors in relation to
HIV transmission and AIDS. It is, therefore, important to study the concept
of risk behavior and its implications for health promotion. Three important
aspects need to be discussed further. </p>

<p>1. The function of risk behaviors is to help individuals and groups
manage the difficulties and problems of everyday life. It would be a misconception
to view risk behaviors <i>per se </i>as deviant behaviors. They are well-accepted
by the social groups who carry them out irrespective of what other social
groups think of them. Several risk behaviors are socially more or less
accepted such as drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, sun-bathing, taking
pills, having sex with multiple partners, driving fast, etc., while others
are viewed as unacceptable by society-at-large, such as <i>train-surfing</i>
(a practice in Latin American and European countries where youths ride
atop highspeed trains standing upright). Some are presented in the context
of sports such as freestyle mountain climbing (in the USA, the slogan is:
<i>if life gets boring, risk it</i>), deep-sea diving, high-speed skiing,
high-speed motorboat driving, bull-fighting etc.; they communicate the
message that those who carry out these sports are somewhat like heroes
(at least for one day). </p>

<p>2. The outcomes of risk behaviors are mainly relaxation, pleasure,
fun, i.e., wellbeing for a short period of time. Risk behaviors involve
only a short-term time perspective. They are always oriented towards a
specific social situation and are characterized by a desire to achieve
well-being as quickly as possible. In most cases, therefore, risk behaviors
are related to leisure because in this temporal context people have more
individual and collective opportunities to decide upon what they want to
do. This particular social sector has been developed in the European and
North American region according to commercial and industrialized patterns.
Numerous facilities offer services which meet peoples' desire to achieve
relaxation, pleasure and fun. From a sociological point of view, one can
argue that there is an industry offering facilities for risk behaviors
- and it meets peoples' needs to get away from everyday life for a certain
amount of time. This short-term time aspect of risk behaviors is an important
factor with regard to health promotion. Health-related behaviors rather
frequently are time-consuming and also bear some amount of uncertainty
regarding their results, while risk behaviors relate to alternatives offering
immediate well-being regardless of their potentially health-hazardous effects.
For example, after a day full of stress, an individual may decide to unwind
by practicing meditation, taking a nap or doing relaxation exercises, all
of which can be beneficial health-wise. However, the alternative of visiting
a bar to have a drink is often more attractive, though it might be damaging
to health depending on how much the person drinks. <i>Life in the fast
lane</i> (Franzkowiak 1987), or living in <i>computime</i> (Rifkin 1989)
does not seem to allow for long-term considerations concerning well-being.
Risk behaviors thus tend to become an integral part of every lifestyle.
The question is whether or not we will be able to reduce the potentially
health-hazardous effects of these behaviors. </p>

<p>3. Risk behaviors are perceived as individual and/or collective attempts
to gain control over certain situations in terms of well-being. The functionality
underlying risk behaviors does not necessarily follow rational criteria.
The term <i>control</i> is used in a subjective way, i.e., as far as the
individual perceives a situation as being under his/her control, a certain
risk behavior is considered an appropriate way to contribute to well-being.
For example, taking a pill may help one to fall asleep in a situation of
constant stress; drinking several glasses of beer may help one get away
from the strains of the workplace. By pursuing these risk behaviors, the
individual pretends to control the past and future: the past because the
behavior enables him/her to escape from a situation so that it no longer
serves as a stressor; the future because the behavior contributes to future
well-being, i.e., the individual will once again attain a position in which
he/she can face reality and to try to cope with it the next day. The problem
with risk behaviors lies in the fact that this kind of control is only
of subjective relevance; it does not affect the causes of the stress perceived
nor does it contribute to an individual and/or collective study of possibilities
of overcoming the difficulties involved in certain situations and experiences.
The main objective is just to achieve well-being irrespective of the past
and future circumstances of one's life. </p>

<p>A further aspect of gaining control can be described as a paradox:
while people have little individual control over their living conditions
and the development of lifestyles conducive to health, people are asked
and forced to exercise individual control over their sexual behavior. </p>

<p>While the distribution of control is generally not individual-oriented,
the demand for control with regard to sexual behavior is particularly related
to the individual. The difficulty of the situation in question lies in
the fact that the individual is not wanted and/or permitted to take control
over various other aspects of his/her life; he/she has only a few possibilities
to exercise strategies and methods of controlling his/her living conditions
and lifestyles. Regarding HIV transmission, on the other hand, he/she is
requested to take decisions, behave responsibly and control the situation
perfectly. It is questionable whether this request can be complied with
effectively as long as the distribution of control in general remains unbalanced.
</p>

<p>Here the implication for health promotion efforts resides in promoting
activities which contribute to the empowerment of persons, emphasizing
the advantages of a <i>long-term</i> perspective and influencing social
norms regarding acceptable risk behavior. </p>

<h1>AIDS health promotion for youth </h1>

<p>AIDS health promotion can be defined as the application of concept,
areas of action and methodological principles of health promotion to the
prevention of HIV/AIDS among the population and/or selected target audiences
of a country, community or area (Aggleton et al. 1990). </p>

<p>AIDS health promotion for youth aims at helping adolescents and youth
(that is, young males and females between the ages of 10 to 24) to gain
and increase control over the determinants of their health, influencing
their lifestyles conducive to health, and prevent HIV infection and the
spread of HIV/AIDS among their peers and in their community (Nutbeam &amp;
Blakey 1989, Erben 1991, Franzkowiak 1990). AIDS health promotion for youth
uses information, personal and mass communication, social support, community
resources and policy changes to implement HIV/AIDS prevention in the community
and with its target audiences. Although young people should be primarily
addressed, it may often be necessary to include community leaders, parents,
and concerned adults as target audiences in their own right. These adults
will need assistance and training in educating young people about the transmission
of HIV/AIDS and all protective skills needed to avoid HIV infection and
its spread. </p>

<p>Programme developers must aim at comprehensive participation and
cooperation of young people and their parents or other educational guardians,
try to secure the support of local services, and attempt to involve all
important political and religious organizations and their leaders. </p>

<p>Programmes provide target audiences of adolescents and youth and
the whole community with accurate and comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS,
effective behavioral skills protecting from sexually or parenterally transmitted
HIV infection, and social support for those already infected with HIV or
having contracted AIDS. Programme development and implementation respect
the community context and are based on cultural beliefs and norms. </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Goals and objectives</h2>

<p>Many programmes for young people are directed towards knowledge improvement
only. These programmes fail to address attitudes, and behavioral and social
skills that young people also need to acquire reducing the risk of infection.
Programmes should be designed as to: </p>

<ul>
<li>improve HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, to develop attitudes and beliefs,
and to promote behaviors among adolescents and youth effectively preventing
the transmission of HIV/AIDS; and </li>

<li>develop and maintain supportive social, cultural, and economic structures
and resources for the prevention of HIV/AIDS being in support of the social
integration of both uninfected and infected youth, and promoting health
in general. </li>
</ul>

<p>The following list presents five overall goals for AIDS health promoters
working with adolescents and youth: </p>

<h3>(1) Give accurate information on HIV/AIDS: </h3>

<ul>
<li>give comprehensive information and education aiming at risk awareness
and HIV risk assessment of adolescents and youth (regarding routes of transmission);</li>

<li>reduce misinformation and eliminate irrational fears, anxieties,
and prejudices against social and sexual minorities (such as men who have
sex with men, male or female prostitutes, injecting drug abusers);</li>

<li>enable adolescents and youth to make informed decisions for or against
HIV antibody testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(2) Develop skills for safer sex: </h3>

<ul>
<li>give comprehensive advice, counselling and practical support; encourage,
promote and rehearse behaviors that are effective for self-protection of
young people and the protection of their partners; </li>

<li>educate for mutual responsibility in sexual relationships;</li>

<li>inform about all possible options such as sexual and drug abstinence,
monogamy between non-infected partners, and safer sex focussing upon condom
use;</li>

<li>focus upon and rehearse proper and regular condom use. </li>
</ul>

<h3>(3) Eliminate discrimination and promote solidarity: </h3>

<ul>
<li>give non-discriminatory information about HIV infected persons enabling
young people to counteract intolerance;promote practical solidarity with
young people or adults with AIDS in the community, their partners, families
and friends.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(4) Develop protective behaviors against drug abuse: </h3>

<ul>
<li>educate against drug abuse in general, including alcohol consumption;
</li>

<li>where drug-induced HIV transmission is relevant, promote and rehearse
<i>resistance skills</i> that enable youth to handle situations where injectable
drugs are being offered or consumed (with a focus on completely rejecting
drug abuse);</li>

<li>among injecting drug abusers, educate for the prevention of needle-sharing
among injecting drug abusers and rehearse protective skills such as proper
needle cleaning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>(5) Improve community resources and social support; </h3>

<ul>
<li>provide adolescents and youth with information on community resources
and services available to them;</li>

<li>motivate them to contribute actively to further development and
implementation of health care services and preventive resources against
HIV/AIDS;</li>

<li>establish supportive environments and care for all people with HIV
and/or AIDS.</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of programme objectives, adolescents and youth involved
in the programme should achieve the following levels of knowledge, attitudes
and values, behavioral skills and social support: </p>

<ul>
<li>be accurately informed about HIV and STD transmission and the nature
of HIV infection, and know about behaviors and social contacts that bear
no risk of HIV transmission; </li>

<li>understand the symptoms of HIV/AIDS and be able to personally seek
and inform others in need about appropriate resources, counseling, and
necessary medical care; </li>

<li>make informed decisions about personal and social behaviors decreasing
the risk of HIV and STD transmission, and develop skills to protect themselves
and others from infection; </li>

<li>identify and reject inaccurate information and stigmatizing myths
relating to HIV/AIDS, and speak and act out against social discrimination
of people concerned; </li>

<li>develop contact and foster empathic attitudes towards those who
are infected with HIV, respecting their right to privacy and confidentiality,
and recognizing the benefits of continued participation in the community
for HIV-positive adolescents, youth, and adults; </li>

<li>contribute actively in the community to the development and implementation
of health care services and preventive resources against HIV/AIDS. </li>
</ul>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Target audiences </h2>

<p>In AIDS health promotion for youth, primary audiences are those young
people who will receive immediate and direct education, skills training
and social support. Secondary audiences consist of people who influence
the primary target audiences or the community as a whole. Among them may
be adolescent peers, but mostly key adults from the community. Those community
groups are defined as secondary audiences whose support and involvement
is desirable for programme implementation. It is mandatory to also target
local people who have been opposing AIDS health promotion efforts or are
likely to produce obstacles to the programme in order to win their support
or, at least, <i>neutralize</i> their negative influence. </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Primary target audiences</h2>

<p>Young people are a diverse and mixed population. In a community or
area, programme developers are likely to find a wide variety of ethnic,
cultural, social class, and religious backgrounds. There will also be important
age and gender divisions or differences in education and health knowledge.
Experience of adolescents in isolated rural communities is normally different
from those in the heart of cities or from those <i>on the streets</i> in
metropolitan areas. Every young person's need for accurate information
and for positive responses to their needs, however, is just the same everywhere.
</p>

<p>The selection of primary target audiences is to be based on sound
epidemiological evidence, comprehensive knowledge about common physiological,
psycho-social and cultural steps in the sexual and personal development
of adolescents, and on results of an initial community assessment. Given
this, highest priority should be given to those young people who practice
high-risk behaviors such as: </p>

<ul>
<li>unprotected sexual intercourse; </li>

<li>exchanging sex for money and drugs; </li>

<li>drug abuse, particularly intravenous drug abuse; </li>

<li>abuse of alcohol or prescribed drugs, and use of illicit drugs;
</li>

<li>skin-piercing other than intravenous drug abuse (for instance, tattooing).
</li>
</ul>

<p>High priority should then be given to adolescents and youth: </p>

<ul>
<li>who have not previously received HIV/AIDS education, and therefore
have no or inaccurate knowledge, inadequate attitudes as well as insufficient
behavioral skills; and young people </li>

<li>who may have already received some kind of HIV/AIDS education, but
upon examination still show inaccurate knowledge, inadequate attitudes
or insufficient protective behaviors. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these high priority youth, AIDS health promotion should
be addressed to </p>

<ul>
<li>all young people who are developing sexual relationships; </li>

<li>all young people who start to experiment with drug abuse or have
friends who do so. </li>
</ul>

<p>When and how adolescents start sexual intercourse or experiment with
drug abuse will vary between cultures, countries and communities, also
depending on religious and legal norms and values. Even within one culture,
health promoters are likely to find differences in onset of risky practices
and the practices themselves. Young people in metropolitan regions very
often start earlier with sexual behaviors or drug abuse than boys and girls
in rural areas. One should also prepare for large differences between male
and female youth or different ethnic and social class sub-groups regarding
experience related to sexual behavior and drug abuse. </p>

<p>Adolescents and youth being at greatest risk of infection may be
identified through available epidemiological data related to the prevalence
of high-risk sexual and drug-abusing behaviors in the region or community.
If such data is not available, one can refer to information gathered from
health and social workers or other community members about the <i>vulnerability</i>
of these young people to HIV transmission because of high-risk behavior
patterns that they usually perform (but which have not yet been identified
by epidemiological surveillance - as in the case of <i>street kids</i>
or drug abusers being also sex workers, etc.). </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Secondary target audiences</h2>

<p>In selecting these audiences, highest priority is given to peers
and adults influencing the sexual behavior of the young population or make
actual decisions about issues of sexuality (or drug abuse) in the community.
An initial assessment provides programme developers with sufficient information
to identify decision-makers and opinion-leaders being relevant to the community
and its young people. </p>

<p>On this background, secondary audiences may include: </p>

<ul>
<li>youth leaders from schools, youth organizations or informal gatherings
such as <i>street sub-cultures</i>; </li>

<li>parents and teachers; </li>

<li>religious leaders, clergymen and church staff; </li>

<li>political leaders; </li>

<li>pop stars and other celebrities, such as athletes; </li>

<li>medical doctors, community nurses, and health staff; </li>

<li>media representatives; </li>

<li>editors of youth magazines; </li>

<li>social workers, youth workers, and other educators; </li>

<li>members of the police force and correctional services. </li>

<li>HIV-infected youth </li>
</ul>

<p>In many parts of the world, it may be assumed that some of the targeted
adolescents and youth or some of those who participate in a programme may
already be infected with HIV. Many young people may suspect that they are
infected - where antibody testing is available and be taken some may be
sure. Young people who are infected with HIV face a lot of problems about
partnership, sexuality, work and social relations. The existence of these
young people must in no case be denied; neither must health promoters be
only concerned about them with regard to preventing them from transmitting
HIV to others. Their well-being is important and should play an integral
part in programme development and implementation. </p>

<p>Information, training and social support for those adolescents and
youth living with AIDS, HIV-infection, or receiving the results of HIV-antibody
testing cannot be put back in AIDS health promotion. These youth need to
be helped understanding their medical, emotional and social situation.
They also need education to avoid risky behaviors, and to help them coping
with possible physical or social handicaps and discrimination. </p>

<p>HIV-infected adolescents and youth need support in their life settings,
and in making life choices. They do not only have to deal with eventual
illness but also cope with years of life during which they feel physically
well. The same <i>safe sex</i> practices that protect uninfected youth
will protect HIV-infected young people from further exposure to HIV or
other STDs that may place stress on their immune systems. </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Programme Development</h2>

<p>The development process of AIDS health promotion for youth programmes
should consist of ten steps: </p>

<p>1. Collecting necessary information through an <i>initial assessment</i>
in the community (assessing the youth situation in general, the HIV/AIDS
situation among and for youth in particular, and the availability of preventive
community resources);</p>

<p>2. Setting up programme goals and objectives;</p>

<p>3. Deciding upon main contents and messages of the programme; </p>

<p>4. Selecting one or more target audience(s) of the programme; </p>

<p>5. Securing community acceptance, networking for community involvement
and ensuring young people's participation in all stages of the programme
(preparing against sources of resistance or potential opponents to the
programme, promoting public discussion about HIV/AIDS and young people,
seeking local allies and political support, establishing advisory boards
or local &quot;taskforces&quot;); </p>

<p>6. Looking for effective ways to reach the target audiences (that
is, identifying effective channels of communication) and developing practical
prevention strategies;</p>

<p>7. Pretesting or piloting of interventions;</p>

<p>8. Planning for monitoring, evaluation and reassessment of the programme;</p>

<p>9. Establishing a programme timetable (schedule) and budget;</p>

<p>10. Implementing the programme in the community.</p>

<p>Adolescents and youth at greatest risks of infection - as a result
of behaviors they may practice, and the known or presumed prevalence of
HIV in the region they live in - should receive immediate attention when
developing a programme. In some countries, HIV/AIDS prevention programmes
for young people put special emphasis on the development of self-esteem,
communication and decision-making skills, and put an emphasis on peer education
aiming at <i>behavioral immunization</i> against risk-taking habits. Reflecting
the needs of homeless adolescents and street kids, unconditional <i>survival
support</i> is often included, like housing, nutrition, medical care, and
education. </p>

<p>Effective behavior change will take a lot of time. Programme planners
should plan for a repetition and extension of programme activities over
a number of contacts, which can last for months or even years. Information
sessions and behavioral trainings for the target audiences have to be presented
repeatedly and in different social contexts over a longer period of time.
Through this, it is to be ensured that preventive messages and related
behavioral changes can be picked up at the time members of the audiences
are ready for it and also in settings where they feel secure and comfortable
enough to get involved. </p>

<p>Information sessions, skills training and rehearsal, and support
activities can and should be simple, frank and direct. It is neither necessary
nor appropriate to concentrate efforts only on teaching biomedical information
about HIV/AIDS. Instead, the focus should be upon (a) simple, concise information
and practical training of how to avoid an infection of oneself and others,
and (b) the implementation of social support and community resources. </p>

<p>In preparing for programme development, AIDS health promotion professionals
should consider practical recommendations: </p>

<ul>
<li>Educate about basics first (presenting the basics about communicable
diseases and drug abuse before specifically getting into HIV/AIDS; educating
about adolescent sexuality, and adolescent development) </li>

<li>Present understandable messages (presenting messages, materials,
and group exercises simply, so that anyone involved directly, such as adolescents
and youth, or indirectly, like parents, community officials, or health
professionals, can understand and participate) </li>

<li>Be specific, explicit and non-moralistic (informing comprehensively
about sexual activities, how to get and how to correctly use condoms, intravenous
drug abuse, the situation and life-styles of sexual minorities, and the
overall life conditions of the target audiences) </li>

<li>Be prepared for gender, ethnic and social class differences (being
aware of strong gender, ethnic and social class divisions in adolescent
development, sexuality and risk-taking behaviors; consequently, designing
the programme so that there is space and time for gender- or ethno-specific
information and training, e.g., addressing and training girls and boys
separately, for a certain period of time regarding specific issues).</li>

<li>Respect parent and community values (being sensitive to culturally-framed
or community-based ethical and moral preconceptions about adolescent sexuality
and HIV/AIDS; if necessary, getting parental, other educators' and guardians'
consent before getting involved in frank and explicit preventive information,
discussions and training with young people).</li>
</ul>

<p>It may often be important, even necessary, to seek and develop culture-specific
methods and strategies to challenge apparent <i>cultural barriers</i> to
effective communication about HIV/AIDS, adolescent sexuality, and injecting
drug abuse. The help and collaboration of community leaders, youth leaders
or community and youth workers from the non-medical professions should
be welcomed by programme developers. </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Communication channels and intervention approaches</h2>

<p>It is necessary to create and present understandable messages concerning
HIV/AIDS prevention for sexually active and/or drug abusing young people
in order to influence their knowledge, values and behaviors. However, as
the history of health education against communicable diseases and decades
of only slightly effective drug abuse prevention have shown, this is not
enough. It is the choice of a right medium that bears an equal significance
for preventive success as does the right message (Hornik &amp; Romer 1990).
Therefore, all messages should be delivered in a way that: </p>

<ul>
<li>actually reaches the adolescents and youth in question; </li>

<li>is sensitive to the needs and lifestyles of the defined target audiences;
</li>

<li>uses or contributes to improving social support and changing relevant
community resources to a maximum. </li>
</ul>

<p>In AIDS health promotion, a key term is <i>channels of communication</i>.
To be or become effective, channels of communication must be: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>credible and sensitive</i> (having credibility for the target
audiences, being able to respond to their needs and concerns, and being
sensitive to cultural, ethnic, social and gender differences); </li>

<li><i>understandable </i>(being able to transmit the necessary information
according to the young males' and females' educational and literacy level,
language, attention span, lifestyles, gender role, ethnic or social class
divisions and still be in accordance with the programme content); </li>

<li><i>available and frequent</i> (being able to actually reach the
target audience and to reach the young people frequently and repeatedly;
</li>

<li><i>involving</i> (having the capacity to capture young people's
attention and involvement); </li>

<li><i>stimulating</i> (being able to stimulate discussion or group
activities by activating informal social networks); </li>

<li><i>participatory</i> (supporting the real participation of young
people as well as other target audiences and the community in the programme);
</li>

<li><i>feasible</i> (being operationally feasible for programme workers);
</li>

<li><i>cost-effective</i> (being cost-effective over time including
the ability to be sustained even after programme developers' input has
finished). </li>
</ul>

<p>There are two main channels to deliver preventive messages: </p>

<ul>
<li>personal communication, and </li>

<li>mass communication. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Personal communication</h2>

<p>Here, messages are delivered to individuals or small groups of people
through face-to-face interaction and communication. Intervention methods
may include classroom teaching, group instruction, behavioral training
workshops, individual or group counselling, group discussions (<i>focus
groups</i>) and community outreach. </p>

<p>Rather than mass communication strategies, strategies of personal
communication have proven to be effective with high-risk behavior audiences.
A good example is the work of outreach educators. Outreach workers walk
the streets and places where drug abusers, street kids and other hard-to-reach
youth live. They distribute condoms and convey explicit messages and skills
which otherwise could hardly be communicated as they would not be permitted
in public or on mass communication channels. </p>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Mass communication</h2>

<p>Here, a general audience is addressed that is and may well stay individually
unknown to communicators. Common approaches include the use of printmedia
(such as newspapers, magazines, comic strips, and information sheets) or
billboards and posters, broadcasting of radio and television spots, public
showing of films and videotapes, public awareness campaigns (e.g., for
condom promotion), staged community events (<i>AIDS action</i> days or
weeks, street theater and drama, music festivals and use of folk media),
and public appearances of teen idols and respected youth spokespersons.
</p>

<p>Mass communication may be appropriate for reaching and influencing
larger youth audiences. They can be addressed on the streets and in market-places,
at worksites, at music festivals or folk media events, in discotheques,
or as an audience to popular youth radio and television broadcasts. AIDS
health promotion professionals may reach out to larger groups of organized
youth like, for instance, males in the military system or adolescents and
youth in local and national youth organizations. </p>

<p>One will usually achieve greater exposure of preventive messages
through mass communication. However, it is not always the better choice.
Mass communication channels may not be appropriate if a programme aims
at young people who: </p>

<ul>
<li>are at high behavioral risk for HIV infection (such as: temporary
or dependent injecting drug abusers, street kids practicing <i>sex for
survival</i>, adolescent males having unprotected sex with men, etc.);
</li>

<li>can only be accessed through highly explicit messages about behaviors
that are socially not or only partly accepted (such as explicit safety
rules concerning injecting drug abuse); </li>

<li>are mobile; </li>

<li>may be resilient to authority or established channels of information
giving. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Personal or mass communication?</h2>

<p>In many cases, a combination of mass and personal communication strategies
is recommended. One may start in a step-by-step fashion. At first, broadcasting,
posters, billboards and community events are used to inform the target
audience about HIV/AIDS threats and prevention. After having enhanced young
people's awareness, health promoters may switch to personal channels such
as outreach, street and youth work, or counselling. By follow-up personal
communication the effectiveness of mass communication on the behavior of
the young people can and will be increased. Condom promotion campaigns
for smaller, high-risk behavior target audiences have been carried out
successfully in many countries by using this step-by-step approach. </p>

<p>Personal communication is often more expensive, shows a limited capacity
to reach larger audiences, and may require a significant amount of programme
time to do so. It can be more cost-effective, however, in changing attitudes
and intentions of young people, especially of those who are hard-to-reach.
Mass communication strategies will reach larger audiences, but may not
be sensitive, credible, or explicit enough for groups of young people who
engage in high-risk behaviors. The mass-plus-personal strategy is appropriate
for many cases, but it should not be considered a <i>simple blueprint </i>for
all programmes and target audiences. </p>

<p>The following list gathers a whole range of intervention approaches
that may be regarded as effective in AIDS health promotion for youth: </p>

<h3><i><font size=+0>Personal communication approaches</font></i></h3>

<ul>
<li>HIV/AIDS education and counselling (in some places also condom distribution)
in and out of schools, in discotheques and other informal youth settings;</li>

<li>Demonstration, role-playing and training workshops for adolescents
and youth in and out of schools (including proper condom use and the rehearsing
of protective skills in order to resist negative peer pressure);</li>

<li>Peer education and protective skills training in schools, in out-of-school
settings, with and for drug abusers in their own <i>scenes</i>, for adolescent
prostitutes, with and for young men having sex with men, etc.;</li>

<li>Community outreach aiming at these target audiences;</li>

<li>Involvement of local youth organizations and the whole community
in peer education, community action, and solidarity for young and older
people with HIV/AIDS;</li>

<li>Telephone helplines and information hotlines.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Mass communication approaches</i></p>

<ul>
<li>Development and distribution of printed materials, photomagazines,
and comic books for adolescents and youth in schools, out of schools, in
specific target audiences, with different level of literacy, regarding
different levels of explicit language to be used, etc.; </li>

<li>Radio and television broadcasts;</li>

<li>Billboards and poster displays in and out of schools, in public
places, informal gathering areas, hospitals and doctors' offices, police
stations and correctional institutions, etc.;</li>

<li>Public awareness campaigns and condom promotion in the whole community
and/or for specific target audiences in their life settings; </li>

<li>Public screening and mobile projection of educational films and
videotapes for adolescents, youth, parents and other concerned adults;
</li>

<li>Community events, use of folk media, and HIV/AIDS education through
drama or plays.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h2>Improving community resources and establishing supportive environments
</h2>

<h3>Reorienting available health services</h3>

<p>If HIV/AIDS-related services or treatment facilities are available
in a community, they may be used as important channels to reach out to
the target audiences - thus, also reorienting their service profile. Clinics,
ambulatories, mobile health services and their personnel are widely considered
credible and effective for obtaining health information and treatment.
Young people attending such services are likely to be responsive to information
and education offers. </p>

<p>Clinics, hospitals, and their staff can also reach out to high risk
behavior groups through the provision of HIV antibody testing. Testing
must, with no exception, be voluntary, non-compulsory and confidential.
Otherwise the audience will not trust the credibility of this offer and
of the whole programme and will never accept it. It is mandatory to combine
testing with post-test assistance and counselling. HIV/AIDS information
and preventive behavior advice must be given to all young people who participate,
regardless of their tested antibody status. </p>

<p>Programme developers must prepare for the special situation of young
clients with positive test results. As they are carrying an HIV infection
with the prospect of contracting AIDS sooner or later, they should be offered
(or referred to) intensive medical and psychological counselling. These
adolescents and youth need long-term assistance and support; on the other
hand, they must be informed in order to prevent them from spreading the
infection to others. </p>

<p>Particularly when working with hard-to-reach groups, AIDS health
promoters may often find it necessary to integrate HIV education and training
into a comprehensive assistance program. Audiences like urban homeless
children and adolescents, mobile urban and rural youth, or male and female
adolescents engaging in prostitution for money, food or comfort have needs
and concerns that go far beyond accurate and explicit HIV/AIDS education.
To improve chances of gettting close to these young people, it may often
be necessary to react to their basic needs first. These will normally include
shelter, nutrition and clothing, medical care and emergency treatment,
education, job and social skills training. </p>

<h3>Networking for supportive environments</h3>

<p>Preparing for possible resistance and resilience to AIDS health promotion
for youth is of extreme importance. Keys to reducing community resistance
are involvement and positive communication. To safeguard against obstacles,
community leaders, such as political and religious leaders or legal representatives,
should be involved into programme development and programme review from
the start. It is also essential to include youth leaders or target youth
into these consultations to help community leaders recognising the needs
that the programme has to address (and, if need be, to help them understand
why some explicit messages or educational methods may be employed). </p>

<p>The following list suggests concrete ways how to overcome resistance
to an AIDS health promotion for youth programme. They were developed and
field-tested in the context of condom promotion. </p>

<ul>
<li>Gain political support from the highest possible sources;</li>

<li>Win local allies for the programme, especially among the press and
media and with community spokespersons;</li>

<li>Meet with potential opponents early to hear their views;</li>

<li>Inform opponents fully about the programme's goals and messages,
its target audiences, the selected educational strategies and materials;</li>

<li>Emphasize condom use and its importance for disease prevention especially
to religious authorities and parents;</li>

<li>Avoid offensive jargon or use of explicit messages if this is offensive;</li>

<li>Be innovative and try to find out ways to by-pass restrictive regulations
concerning public discussion of young people's sexuality or drug abuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the local level, networking is an essential instrument for gaining
active allies and securing community involvement. Its aim is to establish
a coherent network of relevant people, groups and organizations ensuring
that all programme activities are coordinated and integrated. Networking
depends on strong coordination which should remain in the hands of programme
planners and developers. Networking is an effective tool for disseminating
information and methodology, spreading responsibility, creating commitment,
and gathering expertise and resources. </p>

<p>When building up a network of programme supporters, the following
groups and people may be approached and asked for their collaboration:
</p>

<ul>
<li>youth leaders, representatives from youth organizations and associations,
and other NGO representatives; </li>

<li>parents and parent organizations; </li>

<li>teachers and representatives of school and vocational education
authorities; </li>

<li>members of local press, radio and television; </li>

<li>editors of youth magazines; </li>

<li>youth workers, social workers and their local administration; </li>

<li>children's, youth' and women's rights organizations, self-help groups
and counselling agencies; </li>

<li>medical doctors, community nurses and other professionals from local
health care institutions and counselling agencies; </li>

<li>religious and church leaders; </li>

<li>political leaders from the community or region; </li>

<li>police officers and (if targeted) detention or army officers; </li>

<li>owners of coffeebars, discotheques and clubs. </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many advantages regarding the involvement of community
members, such as parents, teachers and doctors, in the programme. This
involvement gives more credibility to all programme activities. It will
increase the likelihood that AIDS health promotion becomes widely accepted
and also encourage the selection of programme workers being acceptable
to the community. </p>

<h2>Monitoring and evaluation </h2>

<h3>Monitoring </h3>

<p>Through monitoring, information is collected and analyzed about proper
programme implementation. This involves regular checking to see whether
programme activities are being carried out as planned and to control for
probable problems, sources of resistance, or lacks in human and other resources.
</p>

<p>Monitoring is an integral part of implementation; it is incorporated
from the start of the programme. Preferably, already existing information
and reporting resources in the community are utilised such as the local
press and community administration. Monitoring must be carried out at frequent
intervals (for instance, once a month or every six weeks). It is recommended
to apply simple information-gathering techniques that are not costly and
provide a rapid feedback. </p>

<p>Programme monitoring in AIDS health promotion for youth keeps track
of the following general indicators: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>achievements</i> (e.g., what does the programme achieve during
set intervals of time? What have been setbacks or failures? Is all planned
information and training available to target audiences at the right time?)
</li>

<li><i>utilization</i> (e.g., how are community and human resources
utilized? How are information and training offers, printed materials, support
programmes etc. used by the target audiences?) </li>

<li><i>supplies</i> (e.g., how many supplies and how much equipment
is needed over time? Do members of target audiences have access to condoms
or clean syringes?) </li>

<li><i>staff</i> (e.g., who works for the programme? Are there changes
regarding programme staff and other people involved?) </li>

<li><i>audiences</i> (e.g., how do target audiences and the community
react to the programme? What are their main sources of information and
training? Do they have proper access to programme activities and services?)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Common monitoring techniques (that can also be applied for evaluation
purposes) include: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>surveys</i> (periodic questionnaire surveys with members of the
target audiences, youth leaders, peers, parents and family members, teachers,
etc.) </li>

<li><i>interviews and discussions</i> (periodic discussions and interviews
with all of these as well as community leaders); </li>

<li><i>work reports</i> (periodic reports from programme workers and
other personnel); </li>

<li><i>service checks </i>(periodic checks with service outlets and
other institutions involved in programme implementation); </li>

<li><i>media coverage</i> (periodic monitoring of mass media such as
local and regional press, radio and television reports). </li>
</ul>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>Evaluation means to collect and analyze information about programme
effectiveness and impact as a whole or with regard to some of its elements
and stages. Evaluation is crucial in the process of pretesting materials
and piloting interventions, and it also includes a later reassessment of
programme achievements. Evaluation provides data about how information,
education, training, and social support have influenced the HIV/AIDS related
knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, practices and skills of the target audiences.
Wherever possible, available epidemiogical indicators, such as changes
in STD and/or HIV incidence during the course of an intervention, should
be integrated into the process of impact evaluation. Evaluation is not
an optional extra: it is and should always be an integral component of
the preventive process. </p>

<p>In AIDS health promotion for youth the following indicators are relevant
(WHO 1990b):</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Access</i> (i.e., did the target audiences have access to the
chosen channels of communication? Did education and training meet their
needs and priorities?</li>

<li><i>Exposure</i> (i.e., how many adolescents and youth in and out
of the selected target audiences were reached by the programme messages?
How often were they reached? How many young people could be reached by
information sessions, peer education, and behavioral skills training?</li>

<li><i>Comprehension</i> (i.e., how clearly were the messages understood
by members of the target audiences? Which of the chosen methods and communication
channels contributed to comprehension, which ones did not?)</li>

<li><i>Condom use</i> (i.e., how many condoms were distributed at which
programme stages? To whom were they distributed them, and how often? Did
the reported frequency of condom use by adolescents and youth change over
programme time?) </li>

<li><i>Mobilization of community resources</i> (i.e., which agencies
and persons from the community could be mobilized to get involved with
the programme? Which community resources were available, which were not
and why not?) </li>

<li><i>Social Support</i> (i.e., could a social support system be developed
related to young people with high-risk behaviors or to HIV-infected adolescents
and youth? What were promoting factors for this, where (and who) were barriers?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reassessment</h2>

<p>Reassessment means to take a second look at the impact, outcome,
and efficiency of an AIDS health promotion for youth programme. After finishing
the programme and its evaluation, it is useful to reflect on results and
the experience gathered during its conduct. </p>

<p>Planned reassessment permits a reorientation of programme implementation
or future programmes. In most countries, the HIV/AIDS situation is changing
rapidly. National AIDS plans and programmes for young people must be flexible
enough to respond to new problems as they arise and to pinpoint the shortcomings
of previous programmes. </p>
