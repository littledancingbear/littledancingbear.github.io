<P>We as people concerned about health improvement in the world, do hereby
commit ourselves to advocacy and action to promote the health rights of
all human beings. </P>

<P>The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of
the fundamental rights of every human being. It is not a privilege reserved
for those with power, money or social standing. </P>

<P>Health is more than the absence of disease, but includes prevention
of illness, development of individual potential, a positive sense of physical,
mental and social well being. </P>

<P>Health care should be based on dialogue and collaboration between citizens,
professionals, communities and policy makers. Health services should be
affordable, accessible, effective, efficient and convenient. </P>

<P>Health begins with healthy development of the child and a positive family
environment. Health must be sustained by the active role of men and women
in health and development. The role of women and their welfare must be
recognized and addressed. </P>

<P>Health care for the elderly should preserve dignitiy, respect and concern
for quality of life and not merely extend life. </P>

<P>Health requires a sustainable environment with balanced human population
growth and preservation of cultural diversity. </P>

<P>Health depends on the availability to all people of basic essentials:
Food, safe water, housing, education, productive employment, protection
from pollution and prevention of social alienation. </P>

<P>Health depends on protection from exploitation without distinction of
race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition. </P>

<P><B>HEALTH REQUIRES PEACEFUL AND EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATION
OF ALL PEOPLES.</B> </P>
