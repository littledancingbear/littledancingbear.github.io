<p>
<hr>
</p>

<font size="2">
<p>You: You mention that people love to take risks; that they would deliberately
run into risks of all kinds. </p>

<p>Me: No, I said that people take risks. </p>

<p>You: I don't take risks. I always take the safe path. I'm not stupid.
</p>

<p>Me: Well, you may believe in this. But I'm sure, you're taking risks
as anybody else. </p>

<p>You: You can hardly say this because you don't know me too well. </p>

<p>Me: I don't have to know you to state that you take risks. </p>

<p>You: You mean, you don't have to know me to be sure that I am stupid?
</p>

<p>Me: I don't say that people taking risks are stupid. </p>

<p>You: But I say so. </p>

<p>Me: Well, perhaps we have to find out what the meaning of risk is. </p>

<p>You: Oh come on, you're starting that word game again. It's absolutely
clear what risks are. Risks are hazards and nobody runs into hazards deliberately.
Hazards may happen, you may be exposed to them but you don't look after
them to come into your life. </p>

<p>Me: What you're saying reflects only one side of the coin. </p>

<p>You: Two sides to every story? </p>

<p>Me: Of course, and maybe more. </p>

<p>You: You mean, there's more than two sides? I don't believe it. </p>

<p>Me: We'll see. </p>

<p>You: What do you mean? </p>

<p>Me: Well, let me give you a different meaning of risk. Risk refers not
only to hazards but also to prospects of winning something. </p>

<p>You: You mean, your talking about opportunities or perhaps taking chances?
</p>

<p>Me: That's certainly a language problem. We've got different words for
the issue in question. But I'm not going into this. I keep talking about
the term <i>risk</i>. </p>

<p>You: O.K., but <i>risk</i> refers to the prospective of loss, doesn't
it? </p>

<p>Me: Right. But if you think about loss, the other side of the coin is
gains. He who talks about risks, always in one way or another takes into
account the possibility of gains. </p>

<p>You: Dialectic thought, uh? </p>

<p>Me: Not so much dialectic but commonsense. You can hardly talk about
risks, if you don't have in mind the concept of gains. </p>

<p>You: Why? </p>

<p>Me: Because you wouldn't know anything about risks, if you don't know
something about gains. </p>

<p>You: I don't understand. I mean, I can see a loss and that's a loss.
</p>

<p>Me: How do you know that the loss is a loss? </p>

<p>You: I compare what I have and then I find out that something's missing,
that is certainly a loss compared to what I had before. </p>

<p>Me: Sure. But how do you know that it is a loss and not just something
else, like something's missing or not-there? How come that you can identify
the not-there as a loss? </p>

<p>You: Because I had it before. </p>

<p>Me: How come that you had it before. </p>

<p>You: I worked for it or I inherited it or someone gave it to me. I don't
know. It was there and when it's gone, it's a loss. </p>

<p>Me: Before it was there it was somewhere else. </p>

<p>You: What do you mean? </p>

<p>Me: What you worked for and was achieved by you, finally, was something
that has been created by you. You gained it finally. What you may have
inherited belonged to someone else before. You gained it. What was given
you, was somewhere else and you gained it. Nothing's just there, you've
got to do something that it's here, that it belongs to you. And when it
belongs to you, then there is always some kind of probability that you
may lose it. </p>

<p>You: Hm. First I get it and then I'm scared that I lose it? </p>

<p>Me: Whether or not you're scared depends on your attitudes and beliefs
regarding the thing. </p>

<p>You: You mean, it's my decision whether I'm scared? </p>

<p>Me: Well, it may be your decision; quite often it's a matter of your
philosophy of life, your religion, or your basic beliefs - all of which
have been developed from the start of your life. </p>

<p>You: You're saying I developed all these things and finally I may end
up being scared that I lose something. </p>

<p>Me: Right. </p>

<p>You: Hm. </p>

<p>Me: What do you think? </p>

<p>You: I don't want to be scared. I mean, nobody wants to be scared. Why
should I want to be scared to lose something? </p>

<p>Me: Well, don't you want to be scared to lose your friends? Or your
children? Or your parents? Or your life? Or your assets? </p>

<p>You: Of course, I'm scared to lose these - well, maybe I don't have
to be scared to lose my assets, because they're just things. It's not the
same with my family or my life. </p>

<p>Me: So, everybody is scared? </p>

<p>You: Everybody may be scared a bit more or a bit less, but in one way
or another, everybody is scared. Yes, I agree. </p>

<p>Me: Why are you scared? </p>

<p>You: Because there is the threat that I may be losing something. </p>

<p>Me: Everybody is scared because she or he may lose something? </p>

<p>You: Yes. </p>

<p>Me: Well, then here we are. </p>

<p>You: Why do you say this? There's no reason to be triumphant. </p>

<p>Me: I'm not. I was just referring to what I said before. I said people
take risks, you remember? </p>

<p>You: How couldn't I remember? It is a stupid sentence. </p>

<p>Me: It's not because we agreed that everybody is scared in one way or
another. And that means, everybody is scared to lose something. Which also
means, that everybody takes the risk of losing something. And that means
that the person can only lose something which she or he had gained before.
While having it, we're running the daily risk of losing it again. </p>

<p>You: Hm. I don't know. Most of the things I have, I will not lose because
I don't take risks. </p>

<p>Me: Are you sure? </p>

<p>You: Why shouldn't I? I know me. </p>

<p>Me: O.K., then let me demonstrate something. If I hit you in the face,
you may lose some teeth. </p>

<p>You: But why should you hit me? </p>

<p>Me: Maybe, because I lose my temper, lose my mind, don't know anymore
who you are and attack you. </p>

<p>You: You wouldn't do that. </p>

<p>Me: I wouldn't do that but it might happen. There's always some sort
of probability that it can happen. </p>

<p>You: Yeah, I get it. There's always a chance that the world collapses,
a star falls down and hits you while you sitting together with your boys
and having a drink. Oh yeah, suprise is always near. </p>

<p>Me: You're right. </p>

<p>You: But it never happens. </p>

<p>Me: The world collapsing? </p>

<p>You: Yes. </p>

<p>Me: It doesn't need to be the world collapsing. Something else may happen.
Like you want to get up from the barstool, slip because there's some ketchup
on the floor and you break your leg. </p>

<p>You: I may go in the garden and an elephant rests in my cherry-tree.
Right? </p>

<p>Me: Right. </p>

<p>You: We can go on like this - might be funny for you but not for me.
It's a stupid dialogue, isn't it? </p>

<p>Me: No. I think we're just in the middle of the mud. </p>

<p>You: I can't see any mud. </p>

<p>Me: Let's summarize: everybody has something to lose. Right? </p>

<p>You: Sure. </p>

<p>Me: Then everybody risks something all the time. Right? </p>

<p>You: Well, there is always the risk that something may be lost. But
it's not because I do something in favor of losing it. It may just happen;
it may be beyond my command. I mean, things happen and you can't do anything
about it. </p>

<p>Me: That's true. And it's exactly what I want to talk about. Some risks
may be at your command, others not. </p>

<p>You: Ah, now you're gonna tell me what I've got to do. It's lecture-time
again. Uh, I smell education. </p>

<p>Me: Be serious. </p>

<p>You: How can I be serious when you're telling me again what the world
is all about? I know there are risks in life. I know there are chances.
I know that life is not just a smooth affair. I mean, life is sometimes
like a horror-trip. Everybody knows it - and you get up and say: well,
there are some risks you can control, and there are others beyond your
control. We know it already, Doctor. </p>

<p>Me: Let's get practical. </p>

<p>You: You wanna get practical? Well, I'm excited. </p>

<p>Me: Your smoking, aren't you? </p>

<p>You: And I'm drinking alcohol, eating hamburgers, don't exercise daily,
go to bed too late, and so on. Yes, that's what I'm doing. </p>

<p>Me: You can stop it. </p>

<p>You: What do you mean? I can stop living? Well, I may perhaps but I
don't want. </p>

<p>Me: No. You can stop taking risks because of your smoking, your alcohol
drinking, lack of exercise, and so on. </p>

<p>You: What will happen if I stop all this? </p>

<p>Me: You're gonna become healthier than you are right now. </p>

<p>You: I'm healthy. </p>

<p>Me: That's what you say. </p>

<p>You: Isn't that enough? </p>

<p>Me: Well, you may feel healthy at the moment; but how will you feel
in a couple of years when you may have developed lung cancer? </p>

<p>You: Lung cancer? Because of smoking? </p>

<p>Me: You know it. </p>

<p>You: Yes, I know. Smoking is dangerous to my health. Oh, I know it perfectly
well. You're telling it all the time I open the next box. Has your talk
been successful? No. Why? Because what you're telling me is a probability.
Everything you're telling me is about probabilities which you call risks.
I call it life. </p>

<p>Me: But wouldn't you like to reduce your risks in order to stay healthy?
</p>

<p>You: In order to die healthy? </p>

<p>Me: Come on, be serious. It's not funny at all. Everyone smoking has
a reduced life expectancy. </p>

<p>You: Everyone living in the city, too. Everyone living in the countryside,
too. In fact, everyone living lives constantly with a reduced life expectancy.
Because that's what life means. It will end some time later. You and me,
we all have to die. </p>

<p>Me: But we may not want to die prematurely. </p>

<p>You: I have already asked you: what does &quot;prematurely&quot; mean?
And you didn't answer to this question. </p>

<p>Me: Prematurely means before your time has come. I know that your time
will come some day but you can do a lot to take care of yourself in order
not to die before your time has come. </p>

<p>You: O.K., let's not get further into what you cannot answer to rationally.
What I understand is that you're saying I should quit all this behavior
you consider to be health-hazardous. Now, when I feel stressed, the best
thing I can do to relax is to have a drink or two, smoke a cigarette and
talk with some friends in a nice pub. The stress I feel makes me sick.
It's gonna kill me some day. And it's not the kind of stress that I wished
to have. I'm exposed to it. I don't have a choice to change that because
I need that job to feed my family and me. You understand? They're gonna
kill me in the workplace some day, if I don't loosen up afterwards; and
when I try to get away from it you show up and tell me I'm gonna kill myself.
Would you please tell me, what I should do? </p>

<p>Me: Why don't you take a walk? </p>

<p>You: Are you kidding? I'm running around the whole day and you come
up with &quot;why don't you take a walk?&quot; I don't need to walk. I
need to relax. I need a drink and a nice chat. I don't want to be alone
on a walk. </p>

<p>Me: You can form a group of people to walk together. You may wish to
do some exercise together. </p>

<p>You: No. I don't want that kind of stuff. I'm tired of walking around
after work. </p>

<p>Me: Well, then at least take care how much you drink. </p>

<p>You: Do you want to educate me how much I am permitted to drink to feel
relaxed? Are you going nuts? It ain't none of your business to tell me
how much I drink. </p>

<p>Me: It is my business in so far as you may end up in hospital and, then,
it's everyone who contributes to your bill by paying his or her increased
health insurance premiums. You see, it's your life, but your disease affects
also everybody else's. </p>

<p>You: What are you going to tell me? Do you tell me that health is my
private responsibility while disease is a social crime? That I have to
stay away from my habits because someone else has to pay a higher premium?
</p>

<p>Me: Well, in fact that's reality. </p>

<p>You: No. That's <i>your</i> reality. You make a difference between health
and disease and thereby, you're defining me being the victim of my actions;
you say it's simply my responsibility whether I am healthy or not - that
is, what you understand regarding <i>health</i>. That's unfair. <i>My</i>
reality is different. I live and work in certain conditions and these conditions
make me feel sick. And I can't change that as I wished to do. I don't have
the opportunities to do so. I have to cope with them rather than being
able to change them. What I'm doing is what everybody else is doing: coping
with life, muddling through. I can't afford your health talk because I
can't afford that way of life which would offer me the options you're talking
about. </p>

<p>Me: What do you mean? </p>

<p>You: Just open your eyes. This life ain't funny. It's a terrible struggle.
It's not paradise most of us are living in, it's more or less hell in one
way or another. I mean, you're coming up talking nicely about changing
my habits. What about changing my living and working conditions? Yes, what
about that? </p>

<p>Me: Do you say that you take risks because your living and working conditions
force you taking them? </p>

<p>You: Well, in a way it's like that. Of course, nobody forces me to behave
the way I do. There's no person standing behind me. But the whole setting,
I mean, just look around: what's so healthy or supportive in this area?
How can you expect from me living and working here, to come out of this
being healthy? How can you possibly expect that? </p>

<p>Me: Hm. I understand you would be interested in being healthy. </p>

<p>You: Sure, I am as everybody else is. If it's a matter of interest,
why isn't everybody healthy? Because most of the people are stupid? Because
they lose interest in their health? Because they wish to die prematurely?
You cannot possibly be so cynical to suggest this, can you? </p>

<p>Me: No. I don't suggest that people want to die prematurely. </p>

<p>You: Good. </p>

<p>Me: But I guess they should do something for their health. They should
take care of themselves - at least more than they do at the moment. </p>

<p>You: How can people take care of themselves if they are not allowed
to take care of anything else? People don't have the power to take care.
They haven't been brought up this way. Power has been taken away from them.
I mean, how can you get power and control over yourself, when more than
90 percent of your life other people and institutions execute their power
over you? Why should I take over their job? If they take care of almost
everything, then they may as well take care of the rest. </p>

<p>Me: You mean, you need power to control your living and working conditions?
</p>

<p>You: Of course. </p>

<p>Me: You need to be empowered. </p>

<p>You: I don't need to be empowered, I need power. </p>

<p>Me: You've got to take it away from someone else. </p>

<p>You: You're pretty much right. But how can I do this? </p>

<p>Me: I don't know. It seems to be difficult. </p>

<p>You: That's for sure. Anyway, I don't care about this at all. You said
I take risks. I say I'm exposed to risks. You say, I should refrain from
my habits. I say they're part of the solution and not the problem. You
say, I should gain more control over my living and working conditions.
I say, you don't help me in that way because you're talking health and
you don't recognize that you're ignorant against power. I sense power every
day, every hour, and almost every minute. </p>

<p>Me: I understand. </p>

<p>You: I don't know whether you understand what I was talking about. Risks
are not an individual affair, you know. It's not that we're so goddamned
stupid loving to take risks. They're part of our lives, perhaps even more
than of your life. But they're here to stay, regardless whether everyone
would refrain from health-hazardous behavior. If you want to do something
about them, look at the risks encapsulated in our living and working conditions.
They're constituting the problems while our habits form a sort of solutions
for us for a certain period of time. </p>

<p>Me: <i>Us and them - we're only ordinary men?</i> </p>

<p>You: Well, Pink Floyd is not the worst source of wisdom. </p>
