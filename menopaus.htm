<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p>The female body has been the target area of the medical profession for
centuries. Aspects of 
production such as sexuality, menstruation, contraception
and fertility have principally occupied the minds of physicians. The male
body has not been the object of similar research efforts - with a notable
exception during war times, when men needed to be shaped and prepared for
national action against 'the enemy'. Then, many medical professionals positioned
themselves in the forefront of supporting national policies - using and
abusing ways and means of medical intervention to contribute to the victory
of the military-industrial complex. </p>

<p>Medicine holds a strong association with the military. This is particularly
documented in linguistic metaphors such as &quot;combat against a disease&quot;,
&quot;war against a virus&quot; and &quot;prevention against illness&quot;.
The medical profession appears to be continually on the war path. There
are always diseases to be fought. The human body has become a battle ground
second to none. Moreover, the individual is held responsible for the 'bad'
body shape and the subsequent necessity of the medical profession to intervene
in its functions. This represents the moralistic side of the issue and
enables health professionals and lay people alike to call on the individual
to &quot;better behave or else&quot;. When it comes to women, one may even
say that the combat against diseases has turned into a <i>War Against Women</i>
as Marilyn French (1992) demonstrates in her book by the same title. </p>

<p>The female body is seen as a reservoir of aberrations which require
constant treatment. The power of reproduction needs to be controlled, so
it seems, by carefully trained health workers, namely gynaecologists. It
is interesting to note that an equivalent professional group caring for
the male body does not exist. Men do not seem to need <i>gender-specific</i>
medical attention. The control of the human body is seen to be particularly
vital during women's fertile years, i.e., from menstruation to menopause.
At least that is what we thought until a few years ago. </p>

<p>Meanwhile we are witness to a new wave of medical control over the female
body which goes beyond the realms of fertility. Menopause has become the
new arena of medical intervention, even women's infertile years are subject
to regular medical surveillance and intervention. One of the last natural
processes has become medicalised leaving women in a weakened position regarding
&quot;what is normal and what is not&quot; because &quot;the doctor knows
best&quot;. </p>

<p>This development is not only a matter of medical preferences and decisions.
The female body is also an object of social powers. The ideological metaphors
of post-traditional societies embrace youth as one of its key categories
around which individual and collective ways of life are to be shaped. The
young body, so it seems, is the only body which deserves its name. Bodies,
by definition, have to stay young, come what may and irrespective of associated
costs. Famous public figures like Diana Ross, Joan Collins and Michael
Jackson represent the success stories of modelling the human body according
to plan. The message displayed by these bodies is: forever young - if you
want to be. Rarely are financial outlays and psychological costs of cosmetic
surgery considered and the idea of artificially constructed &quot;youth&quot;
or rather artificially<i> constructed images of youth</i> is not reflected
upon. The obsession with youth seems to be a universal phenomenon of many
post-traditional societies. </p>

<ul>
<p>The Rolling Stones' &quot;<i>I can't get no satisfaction</i>&quot; was
not, and has never been, just a rock song, but has become the hymn of affluent
societies of the northern hemisphere because it reflects the unrealisable
need for <i>MORE</i>. More of health, more of sex, more of pleasure, more
of speed, more of sunshine - in short: more of everything is good and less
of everything is bad. </p>

<p>The good are young, healthy, professionally successful and extremely
mobile with regard to everything. The bad are relatively poor, narrow-minded
and certainly not mobile. Who wants to be narrow-minded? Who wants to be
poor? Who wants to be immobile? We are told that humans are flexible in
almost any aspect of their existence, particular as far as their body is
concerned. Is fashion not a good example for this flexibility? </p>

<p>In the age of <i>The Rolling Stones</i>, organ transplantations, cosmetic
surgery, and all kinds of body-building have become ordinary events. The
living body has become subject of repair- and style-shops - gender-distinguished,
expertise-based and pseudo-rationally used. We bring our body to the market-place
and look what we can do for it to enhance its quality and value regarding
social interaction and psycho-physical investments in social relations
(Wenzel, 1994: 122). </p>
</ul>

<p>The human body has become the territory of invasive manipulation for
the sake of youth and against natural processes of aging. The body is regarded
to be a domain of expert-led intervention, not only with regard to physiological
functioning but also on aesthetic composition. Both, of course, may go
hand in hand, which is particularly relevant where menopause is concerned.
The promise of hormone-engineers are offers of &quot;forever young&quot;
packages to aging women. Therein lies a promise to make a better machine
out of the aging female body: an ensemble of discrete functions and elements
will be manipulated to the ultimate extent. </p>

<ul>
<p>Our association of the body with &quot;efficient machines&quot; has
crept into our culture in ways other than work. It has created a modern
body type in the machine's image - what one commentator has called &quot;techno-body&quot;.
The techno-body ideal, for men, and increasingly for women, is the &quot;lean,
mean machine&quot;: a hairless, overly muscled body, occasionally oiled,
which very much resembles a machine. For many body zealots, the healthy
body is one that functions and looks like an &quot;efficient machine&quot;,
not a body that is functioning in a natural and holistic fashion (Kimbrell,
1993: 249). </p>
</ul>

<p>With the historical studies of Michel Foucault (1994a,b), the socio-cultural
meaning of the human body has been deconstructed to an extent never envisaged
before. Foucault's micro-studies of the impact of the political system,
i.e., the systems of power, on human beings and their lifestyles and living
conditions have opened an entire new perspective of looking at &quot;human
behaviour&quot;. The behaviourists' perspective focuses on sequences of
interaction under specific circumstances and emphasises values, beliefs
and norms. Foucault demonstrated that there are underlying currents predetermining
the ways and means of human interaction in the social and cultural environment.
While the behaviourists' point of view suggested the uniqueness of the
human being and his/her behavioural conduct, Foucault stressed the embeddedness
of <i>all</i> human action in the social, political, economic, and cultural
context which makes up what we call society. </p>

<p>The human body is subject to social power structures and relations because
it is shaped, almost configured, according to them (Shilling, 1993). Richard
Sennett (1994) has argued that Western civilisation, from the ancient Greeks
to present day culture and civilisation, can be interpreted as an attempt
to secure control over the individual and collective body. Urban environments,
for example, are structured in ways which aim at the subjugation of the
body. Sennett argues that we have lost our capability to integrate pain
and bodily interaction into our social lives; we do everything to combat
pain and suffering, aging and disability in order to demonstrate that we
understand current ideologies of the <i>body as a machine</i> or the beauty
ideal of <i>forever young</i>. The irony of the current <i>body cult</i>
lies in the fact that it aims at controlling human minds. The cultural
and social scripts of Western societies have determined what is good and
what is bad as far as the human body is concerned. </p>

<p>In many cultures people tend to perceive themselves and others as social
beings rather than as <i>embodied</i> persons. The body seems to be a difficult,
almost embarrassing topic of social communication of everyday-life except
in cases of illness, disease and sports. However, as Bryan S. Turner (1984:
1, 8) states in his book, <i>The Body and Society</i>: </p>

<ul>
<p>... human beings are embodied, just as they are <i>enselved </i>...
The body is the most proximate and immediate feature of my social self,
a necessary feature of my social location and of my personal enselfment
and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in the natural
environment. </p>
</ul>

<p>The body is the bearer of the human being and at the same time the expression
of his/her existential, i.e., economic, political, social, cultural and
environmental condition. Individual and social biography are represented
in the body as are the social and cultural circumstances in which it has
been developed. Moreover, economic and ecological living conditions also
find their expression in the human body be it in terms of morbidity and
mortality or in terms of health conditions such as fitness, body weight
or subjective mental well-being. Body awareness, bodily experiences and
bodily expressions are not only subject to individual choices of one lifestyle
over another; they are primarily structured by social communication and
interaction, both of which are dependent upon the symbolic structure of
the social system, i.e., the value system, normative expectations and symbolic
categories such as health, wealth, happiness, satisfaction, power, etc.
(Wenzel, 1983). Relationships between the individual and collective, between
personal and social development, between economic and ecological processes
are both directly sensed and expressed by the body and by the ways and
means of shaping an styling it (Freund, 1982; Lock, 1993; Shilling, 1993;
Turner, 1992). </p>

<p>In introducing the concept of the body as a key element of public health,
we refer to the materialistic basis of both, the processes of health and
disease which are culturally shaped and take place in particular social,
political, economic and environmental conditions (d'Houtaud &amp; Field,
1995). All measures aiming at these conditions, have an impact on body
awareness, bodily experiences and bodily expressions. They interfere with
bodily communication and the interaction of individuals and collectives.
Body, mind and soul form a complex set of interrelationships with their
environmental conditions. </p>

<p>Ren&eacute; Descartes, the influential French philosopher of the 17th
century, stated however, that body, mind and soul are elements of human
existence which can be dealt with separately: </p>

<ul>
<p>I am thinking, therefore I exist. (...) I was a substance whose whole
essence or nature is solely to think, and which does not require any place,
or depend on any material thing, in order to exist ... the soul by which
I am what I am - is entirely distinct from the body, and indeed is easier
to know than the body, and would not fail to be whatever it is, even if
the body did not exist (Descartes, 1988: 36). </p>
</ul>

<p>Descartes' philosophy has radically changed peoples' images about themselves
when it was introduced to the public then. Its influence on our current
concepts of body-mind relations can still be identified in the medical
and social conceptualisation of the body. </p>

<h1>The medical conceptualisation of the body</h1>

<p>Humans and their behaviour (or action) have to be seen in their specific
environmental context. For instance, a person seated in a physician's waiting
room is considered to be a patient. It is at least supposed that this person
needs help because otherwise she/he would not have asked for an appointment.
In the office, she meets at first the receptionist who may regard the person
as a client, i.e., someone who has to be registered in a personal file.
Afterwards, the person may meet the nurse who may prepare her/him for the
face-to-face interaction with the physician; at this point in time, the
status of the person has changed towards becoming a patient. When finally
meeting the physician the patient-doctor-relation is constituted. All subsequent
interactions taking place will make use of the <i>situational dialect</i>
(Hall, 1977) of this specific relation. </p>

<p>It is not a matter of individual intention that defines the context
of the interaction between patient and doctor but a result of structuring,
and, thus, typifying social situations according to their institutional
context and therefore, their functions within a social and cultural system.
In the case of medicine, the relations between the actors are defined by
the professional functions of the doctor and the social role of the client
(Freidson, 1970, 1976; Wallach Bologh, 1981). The doctor's function is
to provide health care; to examine the incoming individuals as patients
who suffer from some sort of disease. The social role of a person visiting
a medical office is defined as being a patient who demonstrates symptoms
of disease which have to be examined and defined by its complementary partner
in interaction, the physician. As Edward T. Hall observed in a slightly
different context: </p>

<ul>
<p>There is no such thing as a patient independent and separate from his
hospital situation (Hall, 1977: 138). </p>
</ul>

<p>As far as their occupational situation is concerned, physicians see
people as patients. As professionals, physicians have been trained to view
people from the medical perspective. This affords a rather compartmentalised
view according to the specialisation of the physician and a rather narrow
one according to the basic philosophy of medicine with regard to human
beings. Norman Cousins (1981) has documented the effect of this professional
system of beliefs and concepts on the role of the patient. An individual
requires ample energy, self-esteem and social support to escape predetermined
situations of doctor-patient-interactions in order to devise ways and means
of healing which meet his/her own bodily rhythms and needs. Of particular
interest in our context is the concept of the body that creates the frame
of reference of medical action. </p>

<p>Hippocrates possessed a rather comprehensive concept of body/mind and
its environment. He felt that health and disease have to be seen in relation
to their ecological context, as we would say today: </p>

<ul>
<p>It is my intention to discuss what man is and how he exists because
it seems to me indispensable for a doctor to have made such studies and
to be fully acquainted with Nature (Hippocrates, 1983: 83). </p>
</ul>

<p>People are what they are because they live in certain environments,
follow mostly local diets, breathe local air and are subject of local climactic
conditions. Health as well as disease are constituted by the interplay
of human action and specific environmental circumstances. The amanuensis
of a person has to be as comprehensive as possible. Hippocrates demands:
</p>

<ul>
<p>... we must consider the nature of man in general and of each individual
and the characteristics of each disease. Then we must consider the patient,
what food is given to him and who gives it - for this may take it easier
for him to take or more difficult - the conditions of climate and locality
both in general and in particular, the patient's customs, mode of life,
pursuits, and age. Then we must consider his speech, his mannerisms, his
silences, his thoughts, his habits of sleep or wakefulness and his dreams,
their nature and time (Hippocrates, 1983: 100). </p>
</ul>

<p>This list of indicators to analyse the health status of a person reflects
a comprehensive concept of health and disease. Compared to current practices
of medical check-ups and the so-called <i>five-minutes-medicine</i> the
Hippocratic approach is broader; body and mind are seen as integral parts
of the human condition; environmental and socio-economic living conditions
and individual and collective lifestyles are taken into account because
it is believed by Hippocrates that they play a decisive role in terms of
health status. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this expansive approach to the human body has been compartmentalised
in the course of medical history. This is partially the case due to ever-evolving
techniques of surgical treatment, and, even more so, pathology. As soon
as it became possible to study the human body after death expertise has
mounted in many aspects of human physiology. Of course, this expertise
was somewhat preliminary compared to the quality of current insight into
physiological processes. With the view of the body as a reservoir of organs
medical specialists came onto the stage that devoted their time to particular
body parts. The anatomical studies of Leonardo da Vinci were still carried
out in the context of understanding the locomotion of the human body. However,
when Descartes published his <i>Discourse on the Method</i> (1637) and
<i>The passions of the Soul</i> (1649), the human body was split into the
biological body and the psychological or spiritual mind. Descartes' concept
is a hierarchical one defining relations between body, brain, and mind
in mechanical terms. </p>

<ul>
<p>... regard this body as a machine which, having been made by the hand
of God, is incomparably better ordered than any machine that can be devised
by man, and contains in itself movements more wonderful than those in any
machine ... it is for all practical purposes impossible for a machine to
have enough organs to make it act in all the contingencies of life in the
way in which our reason makes us act (Descartes, 1988: 44-45). </p>
</ul>

<p>Descartes suggests that we live with a body which carries our mind like
a slave carries his master. The body is only a machine that functions because
the mind tells it to. Related to the mind, the body is seen similarly to
the printer of a personal computer - it is just a device which is necessary
to make the activities of the superior part visible. </p>

<ul>
<p>... the mind is not immediately affected by all parts of the body, but
only by the brain, or perhaps just by one small part of the brain, namely
the part which is said to contain the 'common sense' (Descartes, 1988:
120). </p>
</ul>

<h1>The social construction of the body</h1>

<p>The social construction of the body differs from the medical construction
in so far as it positions the body in the center of human interaction.
That is, the body is seen as the existential basis of human interaction
within given social, political, economic, cultural, and environmental conditions.
Human beings act according to normative expectations they hold <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
(significant) others with whom they wish or have to interact. Interaction
is not value-free nor takes it place in a power-free environment. The way
humans interact reflects the power structure of the given social situation.
With regard to the body, Edward Hall describes the involvement of bodily
behaviour in social interaction: </p>

<ul>
<p>Each culture has its own characteristic manner of locomotion, sitting,
standing, reclining, and gesturing (Hall, 1977: 75). </p>
</ul>

<p>The characteristic manners Hall mentions are developed over long periods
of time and are not subject of quick changes because they are linked to
the social and cultural living conditions of the people. The manners also
represent patterns of behaviour and interaction the cultural meaning of
which is easily identifiable for those who belong to the respective social
groups. For example, certain bodily behaviours are directly related to
good or ill health. People who suffer move differently than those who feel
robust and energetic. People who feel socially accepted and supported move
differently than those who do not. Someone who is self-assured, positive
and mentally strong communicates with a different body language than someone
who feels depressed, oppressed or simply of low mood. All of these expressions
are socially and culturally shaped. In Robert Crawford's words: </p>

<ul>
<p>The body is a cultural object. As our most immediate natural symbol
it provides us with a powerful medium through which we interpret and give
expression to our individual and social experience. 'Human nature', the
category of the inevitable (and often the desirable), finds its truth in
the body. We live within a nature/culture opposition and the 'natural body'
confirms our place within a more 'authentic' order. It is a vital foundation
upon which behaviour and values are predicated. Conversely, as a symbol
of nature the body must be contained and transformed by culture. We invest
the body with culture, thereby distinguishing ourselves from the rest of
nature. Moreover, our biological being, always mediated by culture, delimits
many of our most important social roles. It defines us in relation to others
in kinship, sex, age groups, and larger social units such as race or caste.
Bodily states are key markers in which are invested the social definitions
of the self - not only regarding role, but normality and abnormality. The
body also supplies a universally experienced model of a living and dynamic
unit, an organic whole, a prototype from which we can draw in our attempts
to explain and give meaning to larger social units and experiences. It
is our richest source for metonymy and metaphor (Crawford 1984: 60-61).
</p>
</ul>

<p>However, these different aspects of the body are rarely consciously
perceived. We almost always make our way through this world without realising
that we use our body in manifold ways at every moment in time. We may be
engaged in selecting clothes to underline our body shape; we may take care
of our body in terms of hygiene and cosmetics; we may become particularly
aware of our body when we feel ill. But on a day-to-day basis we rarely
perceive our body language, our bodily behaviour. This is one of the reasons
why we are often surprised when we see ourselves in videos or listen to
our recorded voice, both of which seem rather strange because we are not
used to see ourselves the same way as we are seen by others. Our &quot;manners
of locomotion&quot; are surprising (Hall, 1977). </p>

<h1>The social and medical construction of menopause</h1>

<p>Similarly surprising for us is the process of aging which is more acutely
felt by women than men because their aging process has a clear social and
cultural indicator - menopause. The social construction of menopause as
the entry point to old age represents a challenging and often difficult
time, because, while women may feel rather young and full of energy, society
tends to perceive them as becoming increasingly less attractive and less
fully-functioning. Especially in western societies the time of menopause
is characterised by a series of losses (e.g., loss of youth, beauty, fertility,
libido, health, hormones, femininity and calcium) and there are suggestions
that if possibly impacts on physical and psychological well-being in mid-life
(Brown, 1976; Kaiser, 1990; Buck &amp; Gottlieb, 1991; Howard &amp; Kelly,
1994; Bachmann, 1994). </p>

<p>Added to this, with the accumulation of knowledge on a woman's endocrine
system, views about menopause as a natural transition began to change.
According to much of current medical opinion on the subject middle-aged
women are said to suffer from an estrogen deficiency disease from menopause
onwards (Utian, 1976; Wren &amp; Eden, 1994). In recent decades experts
from fields such as sociology, nursing and anthropology have investigated
menopause and contradicted notions of menopausal women as ailing and diseased
(Formanek, 1990; MacPherson, 1990; Estok &amp; O'Toole, 1991). Support
is gaining for the view that a woman's menopause should not be seen as
a pathologic endocrine deficiency disease because female hormones normally
abate with advancing age as reproductive function comes to a halt (McKinlay
<i>et al</i>, 1992). </p>

<h1>Menopause across cultures: A study of Australian and Filipino women's
experiences</h1>

<p>This perception of menopause as a negative milestone, a time of loss,
a partial death and a disease in many western countries, amidst more positive
reports from women in some non-western cultures, provided the impetus for
the following study that deals with this issue from a female perspective.
Menopause is hereby defined as a normal transition as part of the aging
process and it is acknowledged that while menopause is a biological certainty
and universality every woman's experience is unique. Because menopause
is not a disease it is inappropriate to refer to associated symptoms but
rather to discomforts or difficulties that are transient in nature. </p>

<p>There are, however, certain patterns that have been illustrated to occur.
Reports differ but there has been some consensus that up to 80% of women
in western societies such as Australia suffer from a myriad of physical
and psychological difficulties at menopause (MacLennan, 1988). These include
hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, loss of libido, palpitations,
headaches, osteoporosis, depression and irritability (Walsh &amp; Schiff,
1990). Interestingly, women in some non-western cultures appear to be significantly
less affected by menopausal ills. For instance, Mayan women from South
America (Beyene, 1986) and Rajput women in India (Kaufert, 1982) report
no 'symptoms'. According to Lock <i>et al</i> (1988) Japanese women rarely
mention hot flushes and the incidence of other problems such as backache
and headache is low. It is therefore expected that due to the cross-cultural
nature of the sample certain differences are likely to emerge with regard
to physical, psychological and socio-cultural menopause experiences. </p>

<h2>Details on methods and sampling</h2>

<p>A mix of primarily qualitative research with some quantitative input
was carried out on a sample of 70 Filipino and 70 Australian women over
three phases from July 1992 until June 1995. The tools of the investigation
comprised of unstructured and structured interviews, focus groups, ethnographic
observation and an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Menopause transcends
all borders regardless of socio-economic and cultural background and therefore
an accessible group of women from the general population was selected.
The participating women were recruited from a circle of friends, relatives
and neighbours who resided in suburban Brisbane and Manila respectively
and occupations included that of housewife, teacher, nurse, secretary,
cleaner, nun and domestic help. </p>

<p>The chief criterion for inclusion in the sample was that women had experienced
a preferably natural menopause (without prior surgical intervention) and
could recall what it felt like for them. Mean menopausal age was around
47 years with the overwhelming majority of women having passed through
this stage naturally. Eight Australian and five Filipino women underwent
major surgery in the form of a hysterectomy and/or ovariectomy leading
in some cases to artificial menopause (this varied because surgery was
sometimes carried out not until the postmenopause). </p>

<p>There were some differences in socio-economic profiles. Women in both
groups were aged between 43 to 73 years and while Australian women tended
to live either alone or with a partner Filipino women shared their living
space with an average of four other people. For women in both cultures
mean age came to fifty-six years. Australian women had fewer children (2.2)
than Filipino women (3.4) but educational backgrounds in terms of primary,
secondary and tertiary education were fairly similar. While Filipino women
almost unanimously described themselves as practising Catholics religious
affiliation varied among Australian women (e.g. just over half were Catholics
with the remainder split into almost equal groups of Protestants, Anglicans
and atheists). </p>

<h2>Findings: Physical and psychological menopause experiences </h2>

<p>For over three-quarters of Australian and Filipino women in the sample
menopause was not connected with adverse physical and psychological difficulties.
Women primarily described their menopause in terms of a &quot;non-event&quot;
with associated problems non-existent or barely noticeable. Positive as
well as negative changes were linked with this phase. Regarding the former
better sex, improved moods, more energy and time, greater freedom and happiness,
relief from pregnancy and menstruation and a feeling of being loved were
reported. Negative changes tended to include loss of libido, palpitations,
weight gain, headaches, night sweats, vaginal dryness, hot flushes, depression,
fear of aging, no longer feeling loved and respected and irritability.
In the perimenopause the incidence of negative changes was somewhat higher
than in the postmenopause, the latter bringing relief of discomfort and
a more positive mental outlook. Over time menopausal problems disappeared
and signs of old age emerged. </p>

<p>Across both cultures physical menopause experiences were reported to
be quite similar but psychological profiles differed considerably. Roughly
one quarter of Australian women found it difficult to come to terms with
the aging process and among others listed irritability, depression, fear
of aging, loneliness, mood swings, unhappiness and loss of self-esteem,
respect and admiration. Among Filipino women a more positive outlook prevailed
with almost all of them remarking that they felt only minor if any psychological
irritations. This difference in finding can be attributed to the role culture
plays in mediating menopause experiences. </p>

<h2>Analysis: Menopause in the socio-cultural context</h2>

<p>Major differences in menopause experiences restricted themselves to
the category of temporary psychological adjustment difficulties that are
primarily grounded in a fear of aging. There exists a growing consensus
that a decline in estrogen hormones is not responsible for the formation
of psychological problems (Dennerstein <i>et al</i>, 1994; O'Connor <i>et
al</i>, 1995). As other life transitions, menopause does not occur within
a vacuum and the socio-cultural environment is of key importance in modifying
a woman's experience of her change of life. One quarter of Australian women
in the sample stated that they experienced depression and this reflects
a common fear about getting older. Australian culture venerates youth and
disregards old age (Harper, 1993). Within society there are pressures for
women to live up to clearly defined beauty ideals of young and attractive-looking
women as popular stereotypes dictate. While young women are clearly visible
older women have mostly become invisible in popular media such as television,
movies and magazines. </p>

<p>In western countries such as Australia visual and printed information
focuses on the young and hides the old. For example, women's magazines
are full of advertisements for beauty aids such as alpha-hydroxy acids,
vitamins, liposomes, ceramides and antioxidants which are used in creams
and lotions aimed at &quot;slowing down the ravages of time&quot;, and
&quot;reducing telltale signs of aging&quot; (Tebbel, March 1996: 107).
In <i>Elle Australia</i> (March 1996) the fifteen-step 'beauty survival
guide' advises female readers what to do to achieve &quot;a more gorgeous
you&quot; which includes treatments for eyes, hair, lips, skin (protective
sunscreens and face creams, treatment creams, cleansers, vitamin supplements,
foundations, face masks) and body (nutrition, fitness). Exercise and a
calorie-reduced diet can also help to achieve a body beautiful. While the
efficacy of firming creams and gels in reducing signs of aging such as
wrinkles and cellulite remains questionable (<i>Australian Women's Weekly</i>,
May 1996: 158-159), regular exercise is beneficial for maintaining good
physical and mental health and for menopausal women there is an added benefit
of increasing bone density thereby preventing osteoporosis (Wolman, 1994).
</p>

<p>There is an underlying message that women should desist from 'letting
themselves go' and keep young and beautiful. Societal concepts about beauty
affect women's ideas about themselves (Wolf, 1990). The older a woman gets
the harder it becomes to live up to the beauty standards teenage women
have set. From menopause onwards the masking of the 'imperfections of age'
becomes more difficult (Greer, 1991). Even though previous claims about
the alleged effect of hormones (they supposedly keep biological aging at
bay due to a rejuvenating effect on the skin, a positive impact on libido
and an alleviation of depression and irritability) are no longer supported,
this message is still powerful today (Wood, 1994; Wallis, 1995). Fieldwork
results showed that the crossing of this imagined threshold into menopause
and old age meant for women that they could cope with discomforts such
as night sweats, flushes and vaginal dryness, even if they were severe,
but encountered problems coming to terms with the 'loss of youth'. </p>

<p>The perceived 'loss' of youth and beauty represented a major stumbling
block for Australian, but not for Filipino, women. For the former it was
important to keep looking youthful and attractive because this was felt
to be the harbinger of love, happiness and respect. The 'loss' of fertility
represented only a minor preoccupation as most women had lived through
the experience of birth, mothering and beyond and they did not wish to
extend this role. For women without personal or career interests, however,
grown-up children left a gap when they moved out of the parental home.
Women often described feeling useless, no longer needed or wanted, not
being able to sleep or rest, insecure, depressed, sexually undesirable
and not appreciated and valued for their capabilities and wisdom. </p>

<p>The picture was quite the reverse for Filipino women who predominantly
spoke of looking forward to the joys of old age. Physical changes brought
about by the aging process were more readily accepted, because, while there
were some 'losses' there were also certain gains. Drastic measures to preserve
youth and beauty (e.g., cosmetic surgery) were not resorted to but lifestyle
changes such as taking up light exercise, modifying the diet and a 'mature'
dress style were readily adopted. Being older in Filipino society means
being loved and respected not only within the hub of the extended family
but also by people in general. One Filipino woman remarked that Australian
women are affronted when physical help is offered but Filipino women welcome
support. It is seen as a privilege to be offered a seat on public transport,
having heavy loads carried and being addressed politely with &quot;<i>po</i>&quot;
(madam). Next to this women come into their own as the central figure within
a family and in their role as mother and grandmother being sought as a
source of advice. Getting older was seen as an inevitable part of life
and welcomed. </p>

<h2>A pill for every ill: menopause and hormones</h2>

<p>Another complicating factor principally for Australian women is the
widespread view of menopausal women as ailing and diseased. Filipino women
were largely unaware of these developments and exclusively subscribed to
the belief of menopause as normal. While Australian women ordinarily described
their menopause as natural and a &quot;non-event&quot; a visit to their
physician brought them into conflict when typical biological changes appeared
to necessitate hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Given current controversy
over the issue some medical professionals &quot;enthusiastically endorsed
its long-term use&quot; despite an absence of associated 'symptoms' whereas
&quot;others were against it because of the cancer risk&quot;. As a result
women tended to feel let down, upset, confused, depressed, angry and unsure
of what to do because in their opinion they did not possess sufficient
knowledge to make an informed choice. </p>

<p>Hormonal remedies' claim to fame is due to an association with preserving
youth and beauty well into old age. Since the 1960s, HRT has been heavily
promoted by pharmaceutical companies in lush advertisements that &quot;convey
the message that estrogens are a cure-all for the anxious, wrinkled, sexually
frustrated older woman who has to compete in this era of cocktail parties,
sexual freedom and errant husbands&quot; (Coney, 1991: 159). Progestogen
is promoted to restore hormone balance after the menopause and the young,
attractive woman in her thirties with perfect skin and a glowing complexion
in the advertisement seems to prove it (<i>The Female Patient</i>, 1994:
17). </p>

<p>The campaign to raise awareness of HRT use has been waged successfully
due to the apparent emphasis on restoring youth, beauty and sexual prowess
(Coney, 1991) The stereotype of the menopausal woman first portrayed
in the 1960s is still carried in abundance today in medical publications
which advertise hormones. The social construction of lost youth and beauty
as a disease means that menopause is a terminal blow and only hormones
can to some degree prevent &quot;the death of the woman within the woman&quot;
(Wolf, 1990). Or, in the words of an Australian woman, &quot;menopause
does represent a bit of a death and HRT does make me feel young and makes
my skin glow&quot;. </p>

<h2>Menopause as a normal transition</h2>

<p>The medical definition of menopause as a retrospectively observable
event (Dyer &amp; McKeever, 1986: 218), a demarcation line, an invisible
milestone, allows for too narrow an interpretation. Initial signs of aging
such as a missed bleed are sometimes greeted with shock, disbelief, alarm
and unhappiness. It is usually not the end of menstruation and fertility
that is mourned but the fact that physical signs of aging increasingly
make their appearance in the form of grey hair, wrinkles, weight gain and
less elastic skin. Not all women have immediately grown to love their changed
and mature appearance and many seem to have 'lost' part of their physical
identity. However, it became clearly evident during the multi-stage interviewing
process that in the space of time women gradually come to accept menopause
in a more positive light. The perimenopause was characterised by more frequent
negative perceptions than the postmenopause when most women have had time
to make sense of their experience. Menopause is more than a mere biological
certainty, it is shaped by socio-cultural beliefs and values and spans
over a considerable stretch of time. </p>

<p>Menopause signals continuous change. How a woman feels during the course
of not only one day but over a period of weeks, months or years may vary
tremendously. Depending on individual circumstances feelings towards menopause
underwent conspicuous changes: night sweats were a source of bother and
irritability one day and absent on other days thereby causing feelings
to swing back and forth like a pendulum on a clock. When interviews were
conducted the recorded notes were accurate only for that brief moment in
time. Upon return visits at a later date earlier strongly-held beliefs
tended to shift. Discrepancies were most noticeable when a month or more
had gone by between the first visit and follow-ups. Especially group discussions
represented a valuable source in accelerating the process of coming to
terms not only with the physical reality of aging but also how women felt
about it. </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Menopause, as part of a woman's aging process, does not warrant the
definition of a estrogen deficiency disease against which a full-scale
battle needs to be waged for the remainder of her postmenopausal years.
Physical problems are usually of minor concern for most women but psychological
difficulties due to an inability to come to terms with the aging process
are inextricably linked to the socio-cultural environment. While the Filipino
society protects against similar experiences in Australian culture an emphasis
on remaining young and beautiful places undue pressure on older women to
conform and mould themselves according to the popular stereotype. Hormones
cannot fulfill the promise of a magic cure against warding off 'the evils
of old age', and, while hormones may help to alleviate transient discomfort,
women on HRT never pass through menopause and ultimately deny facing this
process. We have to acknowledge that the term <i>menopause</i> represents
a biological process which has been shaped by social, cultural, economic,
and political considerations particularly in <i>post-traditional societies
</i>(Giddens). Women may subscribe to bio-medical measures dealing with
menopause because they have not been enabled to access different sources
of information. Given adequate time for reflection and reassessment women
generally emerge positive, refreshed, revitalised, happy and proud to have
'managed' their menopause and look forward to the coming years with new
projects and hopes. However, it is exactly this situation which needs to
be brought to the attention of public health and women's health specialists:
menopause is just another passage of life women have to go through. </p>
