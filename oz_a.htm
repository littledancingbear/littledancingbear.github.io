<a href="http://buriedcountry.com/">Buried Country - A Story of Aboriginal Country Music</a> - <font size="2">"This is the extraordinary story of Aboriginal country music, the first and still most popular voice of indigenous Australians - a beautifully written account of the century-old reconciliation of two disparate traditions: black Australia and American country music. It debunks the dominant myth of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as exotic and tied to traditional music. The reality is that many are country people, and like rural and working class white Australians, have long found solace and creative expression in this American musical form. Buried Country shows how indigenous Australians have taken this cultural import and made it uniquely their own"</font></li>
