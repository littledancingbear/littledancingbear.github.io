<p>
In industrialized societies, it has become clear that the technological
development increasingly threatens the ecological system and, thus, mankind
itself. Catastrophies in Harrisburg, Bhopal and Chernobyl affecting relatively
few have demonstrated the risks of industrialization, while the increase
of daily health hazards in the working and living conditions of many people
is rarely perceived in a similar manner. However, risks induced by technology
have changed societies in a wide range of areas and have had several consequences:
</p>

<ul>
<p>At every point, these technological developments are mediated by
social power and domination, by irrational fantasies of omnipotence, by
legitimating notions of progress, and by the contradictions rooted in the
technological projects themselves and the social relations of production
(Noble 1986, 324). </p>
</ul>

<p>The belief in technological rationality as being the rationality
<i>per se</i> seems to be one of the key principles of societies of the
northern hemisphere at least. It has led to a de-humanization of the working
world; it has become a system of functions (work process) consisting of
elements (human beings) which have to be controlled constantly regarding
the quality of the interaction between elements and functions in relation
to set targets (management). Human beings have become raw material and
cost factors. </p>

<p>The working and living conditions of the people are subject of rapid
technological changes which are brought about by microelectronics, information
technology, bio- and gentechnology among others. These changes bear the
potential of sound progress but also of several hazards related to the
health condition of every person. On the one hand, the work organization
controlled by computers and robots may offer new options in carrying out
the work process, on the other hand, they contribute, for example, to the
decline of workplaces and thus, to the increase of the number of unemployed
individuals; they also contribute to the segmentation of the work process
and to the increase of single activities to be carried out per hour, i.e.,
the density of the work process (Zuboff 1988). In effect, so-called <i>new
technologies</i> may also contain the old health hazards of the workplace
such as work-stress, noise, radiation, back pain, etc. </p>

<p>This changes in working conditions also happens in developing countries.
In many cases, the development process is only based on economic parameters,
not taking account of the vulnerability of human beings. As long as the
labor force seems to be inexhaustible in a short-term perspective, it seems
to be difficult to create awareness and stimulate action related to the
improvement of working conditions. In those countries, however, already
facing a shortage of the labor face and looking for migrant workers (e.g.,
Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan) the quality of working conditions becomes
an increasingly relevant issue. </p>

<p>There are many different ways to improve working conditions; many
regard the safety of the machinery and the working process itself; others
are related to occupational health and safety measures like providing health-protective
devices. A rather comprehensive approach towards the enhancement of the
health-related quality of working conditions and processes refers to worksite
health promotion. </p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the conceptual backgrounds
guiding worksite health promotion and to present its key areas of action.
Reference is made to research studies and reports which indicate scientific
activities. Insofar, most of the paper refers to knowledge gained in industrialized
countries. However, it is emphasized that <i>the principles of worksite
health promotion are valid in every setting involving industrialization,
irrespective from where the setting may be</i>. Thus, readers from developing
countries may identify a way of progress including its successes and failures
which their countries will probably face in the near future. By raising
the issue of worksite health promotion, it is underscored that the developmental
process does not have to become as health-hazardous as it still is in many
cases. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<h2>Worksite health promotion and occupational health and safety </h2>

<p>Worksite health promotion has only become a major issue recently.
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), are still governing the minds and
activities of many health and non-health personnel in the factories who
are responsible for the prevention of accidents and the emission of toxic
substances at the workplace. The technological development of industry
during the past century has always created the difficulties and problems
which OHS have to deal with. However, it is not, as some of the conservative
representatives of the industrialized system feel, the imperfectness of
the individual which causes the troubles but the defectiveness of the system
itself (Berman 1979, Brod 1984, Douglas 1986, Kinnersley 1973, Stellman
&amp; Daum 1973, Stellman &amp; Henifin 1989). </p>

<p>Traditional OHS re-acts with regard to problems that arise in industrial,
administrative and service processes. Mainly these reactions aim at the
improvement of bio-chemical, physical and physiological factors which are
interpreted as indicators for certain health-hazards. The strategies of
occupational prevention are oriented towards the individual case. The reason
for this is the medical orientation of OHS and such disciplines like industrial
or occupational medicine, ergonomics, etc. (Dixon &amp; Price 1984, Levy
&amp; Wegman 1983, Rom 1983, Ward Gardner 1982, Watterson 1986, Weindling
1985). </p>

<p>With health promotion entering the working world, the situation will
be changing basically. Individualization in terms of OHS and traditional
prevention will be reduced; structural changes of production and administration
will have to be taken on the agenda. In the European region, the structural
conditions of work play a far more prominent role in worksite health promotion
than it seems to be in North America and elsewhere. Reports from the latter
regions mainly deal with rather classical approaches of prevention, even
if they contain the title <i>health promotion</i> (O'Donnell &amp; Ainsworth
1984, Parkinson &amp; Associates 1982, Cataldo &amp; Coates 1986). What
Europeans call <i>humanization of work</i>, a concept which has been adopted
as governmental policy in the Scandinavian countries and which plays an
important role in other European countries, is the interplay between trade
unions and employers in order to improve the <i>working conditions</i>
of the employees (Aguren &amp; Edgren 1980, Bagnara et al. 1985, Emery
&amp; Thorsrud 1976, Gevers 1985, Lindholm 1975, Reich &amp; Goldman 1984,
Revans 1981, Zwerdling 1980). The concept focuses on the structural rather
than the individual dimensions of work. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<h2>The development of worksite health promotion </h2>

<p>Willis B. Goldbeck, Executive Director of the Washington Business
Group on Health, distinguishes between four generations of worksite health
promotion programs: </p>

<ul>
<p>Programs of the <i>first generation</i> were initiated for a variety
of reasons, most unrelated to health. Smoking policies, for example, have
been in place for more than a century, long before there was indisputable
evidence of the ill effects of smoking (...) </p>

<p>The <i>second generation</i> emerged when risk factor identification
and intervention technology could be transported to the worksite. These
programs were characterized by a narrow focus on one method of delivery,
a single illness or risk factor, or programs offered to only one population
(...) </p>

<p><i>Third-generation</i> wellness programs are those that attempt
to offer a spectrum of methods for delivering a more comprehensive range
of interventions for a variety of risk factors to all employees (...) </p>

<p>In the <i>fourth generation</i> wellness becomes both a component
of and the guiding principle for a corporate health strategy (...) A wellness
health strategy incorporates all activities, policies, and decisions that
affect the health of employees, their families, the communities in which
the company is located, and the consumers whose purchasing decisions determine
the companies relative success in the marketplace (O'Donnell &amp; Ainsworth
1984, vi-vii). </p>
</ul>

<p>The development of health promotion programs in the USA is hereby
described - both in terms of its history and presence. However, the fourth
generation represents an approach which is only seldom realized - whether
in North America, Europe, or anywhere else in the world. Programs of the
first till the third generation follow an individualistic approach, i.e.,
they are oriented towards individual behavior without taking too much into
account which of the implications of the working condition may be effective
in damaging workers' health. In their study <i>Occupational Health Promotion</i>,
Everly &amp; Feldman (1985) only state in one paragraph that health promotion
may be concerned with structural working conditions; it reads: </p>

<ul>
<p>Personal health behavior is due to a complex set of factors and individuals
are not to blame for their unhealthy life-styles. In addition, health professionals
involved in work settings need to be especially aware of work hazards in
order to ensure that employees work in a safe and healthy environment.
For example, a smoking cessation program for asbestos workers would have
minimum impact if at the same time exposure to asbestos fibers were not
reduced to a safe level (Everly &amp; Feldman 1985, 301). </p>
</ul>

<p>Shain et al. go one step further, however, without presenting a program
of worksite health promotion related to working conditions. In their analysis
of worksite health promotion, they conclude: </p>

<ul>
<p>1. The individual intervention approach holds individuals responsible
for their health while downplaying environmental sources of disease, thereby
blaming individuals for sources of illness that are presently beyond their
control. </p>

<p>2. Following this, the approach encourages a myopic self-centered
view of disease and health, deflecting attention away from the possibility
of collective, political and social action in health-related issues. </p>

<p>3. The approach is strongly middle-class-biased with little attention
paid to the concerns and realities of those who are not. </p>

<p>4. The approach focuses exclusively on the individual, as opposed
to any social special interest groups (Shain et al. 1986, 48). </p>
</ul>

<p>With regard to worksite health promotion, one can conclude that changes
demanded in health-related behavior have also to be described in terms
of changes concerning working conditions, i.e., which quality and structure
of workplaces and work-processes are prerequisite to stimulate and stabilize
health-promotive physical, mental <i>and</i> social well-being of employees.
As Sloan et al. (1987, 54) put it: </p>

<ul>
<p>By supporting risk-related behavior change, incidence of disease
will be reduced over time; but disease-related absenteeism and insurance
claims account for only part of the overall corporate health costs. Organizational
factors influencing illness behavior clearly are responsible for another
large portion of the total cost of health care. It is critical that practicioners
understand the reciprocal relationship between the organization and the
individuals who compose it. For workplace health promotion to have its
fullest impact, programs will have to address both the organization and
the individuals. </p>
</ul>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<h2>Workstyles conducive to health </h2>

<p>If the assumption is correct that there is a constant interplay between
working conditions and work-/health-related patterns of behavior and action,
it seems to be reasonable to integrate this argument into the conceptualization
of worksite health promotion. I suggest that this context is named <i>workstyles</i>.
The main objective of health promotion programs for the working world is
the development of workstyles conducive to health. </p>

<p>By <i>individual workstyles</i>, I refer to the occupational and
organizational patterns of behavior and action of a person, by which normative
expectations regarding workplace- and occupation-related efficiency are
met. Individual workstyles are subjectively developed potentials of action
and concrete behaviors; they are demanded independently from a person by
the work organization in terms of work-descriptions and in terms of the
design of the workplace. Through individual workstyles a person demonstrates
his or her capability to participate in the work-process pragmatically.
In other words, individual workstyles represent what one could call <i>work-related</i>
or <i>occupational identity</i>. </p>

<p>The (socio-) psychological competencies and the occupational qualifications
of a person are set on the level of individual workstyles. It is the same
level, individual coping strategies are settled on. Individual workstyles
represent the subjective competence, a person has developed through his
or her biography in order to become and stay a member of the labor-system.
</p>

<p>Individual workstyles represent a complex system of mutually determining
variables, the change of which will only be achieved, if their interdependencies
are taken into account. Purely behavior-related measures, which aim at
one or two aspects of individual workstyles will not be very successful
in terms of worksite health promotion. </p>

<p>By <i>collective workstyles</i>, I refer to socially, culturally,
historically, technologically, politically and economically developed <i>patterns
of action</i>, which are related to specific occupations and which are
developed during vocational training and the first years of occupational
socialization. They form a reservoir of shared values and normative orientations
towards his/her own professional group as well as to other professional
groups. By collective workstyles, the person gains his/her <i>professional
identity</i>, which enables the individual to form professional and political
relations to his/her colleagues, i.e., to achieve the capabilities for
solidarity. It is the level of collective workstyles, the expectations
regarding (health-related) working conditions and workplaces are combined
with, while dealing with certain health-related behaviors is a matter of
individual workstyles. </p>

<p>The analytical distinction between individual and collective workstyles
- which pragmatically complement each other - indicates that worksite health
promotion is not only a matter of OHS but goes deeply into the biographical
structure of an individual and his/her occupational and professional identity.
Health promotion also always affects the organization of work and work-processes.
Thus, one has to be aware of the long-term time-perspective that worksite
health promotion bears. </p>

<p>To be employed is a fact which contains more than just fulfilling
the expectations of the employers efficiently. It is not just a matter
of spending some 8 hours at the work-place. The time-budget concerning
all work-related activities can go up to almost 12 hours a day. It is a
principle question of worksite health promotion whether or not employees
can be asked to further intensify their work-related activities and health-related
behaviors. This issue is discussed under the label of <i>ethics of worksite
health promotion</i> (Allegrante &amp; Sloan 1986, Roman &amp; Blum 1987,
Warner 1987, Watterson 1984). However, I feel that the ethical dimension
is only one aspect while time-organization, access to public transport,
housing, work-intensity, quality of workplaces, participation in work organization
etc. are others strongly affecting the employee's willingness and capability
to participate in health-related activities (Mergler 1987, Webb et al.
1986, Carlstein 1982, Fraser 1978, Grazia 1964, Rifkin 1989, Szalai et
al. 1972, UNESCO 1976). </p>

<p>It seems to be necessary to consider the basic principles of worksite
health promotion in the light of the <i>Ottawa-Charter</i> and the outlined
concept of individual and collective workstyles. The behavioral implications
of health promotion in general, i.e., the development of lifestyles and
workstyles conducive to health, are always linked to structural changes
of the environment, which have to be carried out simultaneously. It is
nearly impossible for the individual and social groups to develop health-promotive
patterns of behavior and action in an ecological system which destroys
the health of the population by toxic and radioactive substances, health-hazardous
workplaces and products, over-crowded housing areas, air and water pollution,
etc. Health is an issue which cannot be divided into a rating scale; it
is a similar concept like peace. It is a contradiction <i>per se</i> to
develop lifestyles conducive to health in a society which produces unhealthy
products and environments. This must not be interpreted that the attainment
of these lifestyles is impossible; it rather emphasizes that their development
is partly inhibited by the prevailing conditions; and it stresses the more
the notion that there is no reason at all to blame individuals and groups
if they are not capable to meet behavioral standards set by medical professionals
and other influential and powerful groups of society. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<h2>Issues in worksite health promotion </h2>

<h3>The changing working world </h3>

<p>The working world is the key sector of our social system because
it produces the fundamental contributions to keep the system functioning.
Labor organization, the distribution of power and influence, the relationships
between employers and employees plus other aspects reflect the overall
social structure of a society. On the other side, their shaping contributes
to the further development of the society. While the societal level represents
values, belief systems, economic, social and cultural dimensions of a society,
the labor system presents the application of these system elements in a
rather materialistic way. The key element of the labor sector, i.e., the
alienation from oneself, one's work and one's individual and collective
actions, distinguishes this sector from other sectors of the social system.
Alienation may take place there, but it is not incorporated by them <i>per
definitionem</i>. </p>

<p>The human body is no more a relevant issue in the working world,
which is build on the fundaments of high-tech. It is reduced to its mental
efficiency. Within this structure, well-being does not mean more than the
adaptation of workers to the work organization. It is requested that employees
feel comfortable with their workplaces, however their well-being is not
a prerequisite for the efficiency of the work organization as such. <i>Work
is dangerous to your health</i> - this is the precise formula which Jeanne
Stellman &amp; Susan Daum (1973) used as the title of their analysis of
occupational hazards. Shoshana Zuboff states: </p>

<ul>
<p>In diminishing the role of the worker's body in the labor process,
industrial technology has also tended to diminish the importance of the
worker. In creating jobs that require less human effort, industrial technology
has also been used to create jobs that require less human talent. In creating
jobs that demand less of the body, industrial production has also tended
to create jobs that give less to the body, in terms of opportunities to
accrue knowledge on the production process (Zuboff 1988, 22). </p>
</ul>

<p>Parallel to the computerization of work-processes, automatization
of the workplace is implemented, the ultimate effect of which is the decrease
of human interventions into the production process. On the other side,
middle- and top-management face a fundamental change in their work-processes
as well: through the implementation of information management, both, density
and control of the work-load and work-processes are enhanced, while the
individual control over the work-process decreases. </p>

<ul>
<p>Right now a combination of twentieth-century technology and nineteenth-century
scientific management is turning the Office of the Future into the factory
of the past. At first this affected clerks and switchboard operators, then
secretaries, bank tellers and service workers. The primary targets now
are professionals and managers (Garson 1988, 10). </p>
</ul>

<p>And she concludes: </p>

<ul>
<p>Computers are only tools with many uses. But the battle for control
turns tools into weapons (Garson 1988, 154). </p>
</ul>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<h2>Participation </h2>

<p>WHO's health promotion concept is based upon several principles,
one of the most important one is called participation. People are requested
to participate in the development, implementation and evaluation of health
promotion programs directly affecting their living and working conditions.
The strengthening of community action with regard to health promotion represents
one of the major goals of the <i>Ottawa-Charter</i> and the <i>Call for
Action</i>. In practice, the issue of participation refers to the involvement
of the people into the organization of community life. Participation, i.e.,
the right to decide jointly about common issues, means that the people
are able to decide whether or not which kind of health promotion program
is carried out in their social, cultural and ecological environment. </p>

<p>The key question concerning participation is: who participates in
what and who has defined which &quot;what&quot; is (Brizziarelli 1989)?
Basically, participation is regulated by legislation, i.e., it refers to
certain rights and duties. It does not necessarily cover activities which
are initiated spontaneously by individuals and/or social groups. Such activities
may be considered as social action which lie outside of the frame of reference
of participation. At least in the welfare states of Western Europe and
Scandinavia, legislation concerning so-called <i>co-determination</i> of
employees clearly defines those issues which can be dealt with within the
co-determination process. Other issues not mentioned, cannot become subject
of co-determination except by changes in legislation. Therefore, the participatory
approach of co-determination finds its limits within given legislation.
</p>

<p>Current legislation in the Federal Republic of Germany, for example,
defines co-determination as an approach which is linked to the elected
representatives of the employees of a given company. There is no possibility
for individual workers to get involved in co-determination, but only through
the election of their representatives. In this case, all kinds of issues
related to the design of workplaces, work organization and work-processes
are dealt with by the employees' committee; only this committee can put
the issues on the agenda of its negotiations with the management. Within
this frame of reference, participation is defined collectively and according
to the principles of representative democracy. In a certain way, participation
is centralized. </p>

<p>Taking into account WHO's concept of health promotion, participation
would go one step further. Here, it is also related to the single person
who should have the opportunity to participate in the development, implementation
and evaluation of such programs. It seems to be obvious that this kind
of participation is quite different from current approaches. In practice,
it has to be clarified how individual participation is to be realized.
Which regulations have to be implemented that individual participation
becomes possible? Which kind of committees would form the arena in which
participatory action is carried out? Which rights and duties of these committees
are installed? </p>

<p>Representatives of the trade unions would argue that individual participation
would undermine the power of trade unions and also perhaps the solidarity
among employees. The collective representation of employees' interests
by the trade unions would guarantee the influence of the employees concerning
the design of workplaces, work organizations etc., while individual participation
would only be in a position to take care of the interests of one specific
employee. The collective aspects of work processes in a factory are obvious:
</p>

<ul>
<p>... a production process with a technology that demands the exercise
of skill simultaneously grants workers a measure of control over the production
process and <i>gives them a work-based reason to form the groups and develop
cultures centered around the maintenance and extension of their control</i>.
Workers in such a process simply find that their job gives them a lot of
reasons to talk to each other about the work. To put it another way, their
involvement in work leads them to become involved with one another (Grzyb
1981, 467). </p>
</ul>

<p>It seems, however, that the production process tends to become less
skill-demanding; trained workers will be replaced either by robots or by
unskilled workers. This may affect the capacities of the labor force to
take care of the quality of working conditions; it may also affect the
motivation to get organized in trade unions resulting probably in rather
weak solidarity among the workers and, ultimately in reduced participation.
<i>In the age of the smart machine</i> (Zuboff), the exercise of skills
is only demanded from those who control the production process using more
or less complex computer systems. And even the process of control becomes
subject of computer systems: </p>

<ul>
<p>Whether such computerized monitoring systems are used to discipline
particular individuals is, finally, beside the point. It is enough that
they exist, a kind of software sword of Damocles suspended over people's
heads, ready to be brought into play at management's discretion. Worse,
this fundamental arbitrariness is disguised by the seeming objectivity
of the data. To the degree that the unambiguous measurements of the computer
are <i>scientific</i>, they have the appearance of rationality. They serve
to obscure the very relationship of unequal power that they reinforce (...)
In a sense, control becomes <i>automatic</i>, just like work it-self. And
the reality of power disappears behind the impersonality of the machine
(Howard 1985, 65). </p>
</ul>

<p>It seems to become rather difficult to find ways and means of participation
in a working world which becomes increasingly controlled by computerized
monitoring systems demanding and leaving few opportunities for individual
and collective involvement into the work process. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<h2>Examples of worksite health promotion programs </h2>

<p>Reviewing the current state of worksite health promotion in the USA,
four different areas of activities have been identified (Fielding &amp;
Piserchia 1989, Pender 1989): </p>

<ul>
<li>coping with stress </li>

<li>weight reduction and nutrition education programs </li>

<li>physical education (&quot;fitness programs&quot;) </li>

<li>improvement of safety at the workplace. </li>
</ul>

<p>Programs undertaken in these areas mainly focus on individual behavior.
Workers are targeted to change their behavior according to the set of objectives
of the respective (preventive) program. Of course, the individual behavior
can only be one facet of the working world. Working conditions, i.e. the
quality of work, plus the general lifestyles and living conditions of workers
play an even more important role to bring about health-promotive changes
at the workplace. </p>

<p>As an illustration for an integrated approach to worksite health
promotion, two different programs come to mind. First, the Swedish work
reform initiative, and secondly the worksite health promotion program in
Queensland (Australia). </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<h3>The Swedish work reform initiative </h3>

<p>In Sweden, legislation regarding occupational health and safety and
worksite health promotion is very much elaborated. The industrial relations
between employers and employees are subject of national legislation. The
participation of the employees and the trade unions with regard to work-
and health-related issues is guaranteed. Occupational health and safety
standards in Sweden are rather high; the involvement of the employees into
health-related aspects of working conditions and workplaces is still increasing.
The issue of health promotion is integrated into the occupational health
and safety departments. At first glance, this might look rather traditional;
however, the Swedish approach of OHS has been broadened during the past
years so that health promotion at the worksite has become an integrated
part of it. </p>

<p>The design of workplaces and work processes has been a prominent
task of OHS in Sweden. The example of Volvo has become quite familiar to
experts of the field. I will not refer to it in this paper (Aguren et al.
1976), but briefly describe a training manual on <i>Safety-Health and Working
Conditions</i> which is published by the <i>Joint Industrial Safety Council
of Sweden</i> (1987). The target group of the manual are shop stewards
as well as other employees, company doctors, nurses, safety engineers,
management - whoever wants to get involved into the subject. In the introduction,
it says: </p>

<ul>
<p>This manual is designed to help you start discussing safety, health
and working conditions of all the workers at your workplace. </p>
</ul>

<p>The manual is divided into 7 chapters, covering the following issues:
</p>

<ul>
<li>training for safety, health and working conditions, </li>

<li>people, safety, health and technical equipment, </li>

<li>workplace climate, lightning and noise, </li>

<li>chemical risks to health, </li>

<li>ergonomics: fitting work to man, </li>

<li>work organization and working time, </li>

<li>daily activity for safety, health and well-being. </li>
</ul>

<p>The attached checklist provides a subject-related comprehensive questionnaire,
which can be used by the employees themselves to analyze the specific quality
of their workplaces and working conditions. </p>

<p>The manual is used in training sessions with groups of employees.
The group approach should guarantee that different perspectives on the
subject as well as a variety of possible solutions to particular problems
can be carried out. It also reflects the aspect of solidarity among workers,
i.e., the manual takes into account the individual and collective dimensions
of workstyles. </p>

<p>The training program aims at two different objectives: </p>

<ul>
<li>to increase awareness among employees regarding health and safety
aspects of their specific workplaces and the overall working conditions
of their work organization; </li>

<h3>Workplace health promotion in Queensland (Australia) </h3>

<p>Acknowledging the shortcomings of an individual-oriented approach,
Chu &amp; Forrester (1992, 13) state that workplace health promotion <i>&quot;does
not simply (examine) health behaviour but also includes the workplace environment
and the organization of work itself&quot;</i>. In their report to the Minister
of Health, Housing, and Community Services of the State of Queensland (Australia)
they recommend the following key issues of workplace health promotion (WHP):
</p>

<ul>
<li>that WHP be made an integral part of a corporate culture. Programs
should be comprehensive in nature, address both individual risk factors
and the broader environmental and structural issues, and have ongoing and
long-term managerial commitment. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>that WHP programs which aim to improve worker's health by addressing
individual risk factors also consider the underlying workplace structures
and practices which bring about exposure to such hazards and how improvements
might be made which can result in better health. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>that a community development approach emphasising grass-roots participation,
self determination and empowerment be adopted as an essential WHP strategy
to involve workers in the planning, decision making, organisation, and
implementation of WHP programs. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>that WHP be an activity shared by both employees and employers,
with health professionals acting as facilitating and mediating agents (Chu
&amp; Forrester 1992, 61). </li>
</ul>

<p>These recommendations have been applied meanwhile to different projects
in Queensland. They are currently in their planning and implementation
stage. Since the Queensland approach seems to be by far the most comprehensive
one described in the literature, it is of utmost interest to monitor the
processes of change at the worksite and to evaluate the outcomes of the
projects. It would certainly provide a much needed insight into structures
and mechanisms of comprehensive workplace health promotion. This would
be particularly useful regarding the transfer of the approach to other
countries. </p>

<p>

<h3>Steps of planning worksite health promotion </h3>

<p>It should have become clear that health promotion programs for the
working world have to be designed more comprehensively than it has been
done so far. Taking into account WHO's concept of health promotion, worksite
health promotion is just one element of programs addressing the entire
community. Thus, worksite health promotion is also a public affair although
in many parts of the world, the economic system is mainly organized as
private enterprises. </p>

<p>Therefore, before starting any planning activities, it is inevitable
to bring together all people, groups, and organizations which are affected
by such programs in order to discuss whether or not they would participate
in the program, and whether or not they would support its objectives and
activities. I feel that many projects have difficulties to implement their
activities into the working world because the relevance of their issue
is not recognized by those who should be concerned with the problems (Felix
et al. 1985). </p>

<p>The <i>first step</i> of planning is to create awareness of the need
for health promotion at the work place among all of the possible participants,
particularly among the organizations to be involved into the program. This
process may last several months. </p>

<p>If there is an agreement upon what to do, the <i>second step</i>,
the planning process can be started by involving representatives of all
groups concerned in order to carry out a program which reflects the interests
of all participants. This process, again, may last several months because
the program has to be discussed among all participants and their organizations
involved; there will be suggestions what should be done in a different
way etc. The political debate upon the project among trade unions, employers'
association, etc. will influence the planning process quite a lot. Public
discussion in the community about the planned program may also affect program
planning, particularly if the company in question plays a major economic
and political role in the community. </p>

<p>By pointing out to these facts, I want to create awareness among
health planners and health promoters regarding the difficult political,
social, and economic aspects that are linked to worksite health promotion.
One cannot neglect them, but has to keep them in mind during the entire
duration of planning and implementation of such programs. </p>

<p>If there is an agreement found upon the concrete program, the <i>third
step</i>, its implementation requires careful activities regarding the
information of all employees and those of the community who are affected
by the measures of the program (families, neighborhood, social services,
etc.). This step aims at the necessary support to the program given by
all individuals, groups, and organizations in the community. </p>

<p>The implementation requires a detailed analysis of the time-schedule
of the employees at work in order to find out their capabilities to carry
out the activities the program intends them to do. The time-analysis provides
insight into the structural possibilities of the employees to become involved
into the program (Rifkin 1989, Moore-Ede 1993, Burns 1993). </p>

<p>The implementation of the program depends upon the working conditions
of the employees, i.e., the degree of flexibility at the workplace which
allows for the involvement into certain program activities. It is this
particular aspect which decides upon success and failure of the program,
because if the employees feel that the program interferes with their working
process too much, they will not participate in it as wanted. Thus, the
implementation of worksite health promotion always requires the willingness
of employers to provide time and flexibility regarding the realization
of the program; and it is this issue which usually interferes with the
demands of the production process. </p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>

<p>Public policies increasingly address the issue of developing lifestyles
and living conditions conducive to health in order to contribute to an
improvement of the quality of life of all people regardless of social class,
gender, race or any other indicator. Health promotion has become the key
word in this respect. Health has become a human rights issue. At least,
it has become a concept through which those population groups which are
deprived of living conditions conducive to health are able to communicate
the lack of meeting their basic needs. Health as well as ecology are terms
of the public discourse of concerned people who feel the need that the
developed countries have to make basic changes in their structure and functions.
If these societies will be able to switch to ways of sustainable development,
depends heavily on their capability to restructure their economy as well
as their entire value systems and subsequently, their ways of life. </p>

<p>Worksite health promotion is happening in one social sector. It has
to be linked to similar activities in other sectors in order to accomplish
what it intends to achieve: health for all. As other sections in this book
demonstrate, these links are about to be developed. It would be, however,
fairly naive if we would think that health promotors were the ones who
would bring about the necessary changes. Health promotors are facilitators
at best. If the people do not see the advantages of restructuring their
lifestyles and living conditions, no substantial change will happen. Social
changes always implicate changes in the economy; more often than not, they
depend on economic changes. As Saul B. Alinsky (1969, 219) put it so rightly:
</p>

<ul>
<p>Our world has always had two kinds of changers, the social changers
and the money changers. </p>
</ul>

<p>I am afraid to say that health promotors at the worksite need to
be both. </p>
