Initially called the Aboriginal History Committee (AHC), the organisation came into being on

the fate of a contemporary Aboriginal urban heritage site in Sydney, threatened with 
demolition by redevelopment plans. The site was the venue of the first national Aboriginal

Indigenous people seek better recognition and protection of their Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property. The Our Culture: Our Future Report is the first of its kind to comprehensively map the rights Indigenous Australians want to their cultural heritage and to comprehensively analyse the laws and policies that affect the ability of Indigenous Australians to realise these rights. The Report also lists a range of measures for protecting Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property"</font></li>
