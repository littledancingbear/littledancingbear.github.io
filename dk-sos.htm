accountants and lawyers, to help them hide, conceal, launder, defile, disguise,
dissemble, obfuscate, falsify, misrepresent, evade, delay, lay down smoke
screens, equivocate, put on an act, keep under their hat, paint, varnish,
gild, daub, enamel, lacquer their cover stories, to hoodwink the poor they
fleece, rip off, fob off, skim, scam and stuff with no moral conscience
whatsoever, so that they can spend their spoils on the usual consumerist
gash of the tax evader, one third of the working people in the world, earn
a dollar a day or less and this makes me remonstrate, dissent, avow social
justice, stand firm for honesty and generally assert that we have had quite
enough of their shenaginans, chicanery, improbity, deceit, duplicity, guile,
double dealing and bamboozling monkey business because it's high time that
everyone was treated as equal under the law and that long sentences were
applied, for once, to perjuring, story telling racketeering, law breakers,
even when, as is not unusually the case, they are inclined (in receipt
of the myriad flunky obsequences of the day) to think of themselves as
good public spirited "chaps" but of course being something of a buddhist
myself, I don't hold any strong feelings on the subject.</FONT>
