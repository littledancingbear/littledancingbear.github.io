<FONT SIZE=+1>In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream 
<BR>
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines 
<BR>
Sprung from cages out on highway 9, 
<BR>
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line 
<BR>
Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
<BR>
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
<BR>
We gotta get out while we're young 
<BR>
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
<BR>
<BR>


Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend I want to guard your dreams and visions 
<BR>
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims and strap your hands across my engines 
<BR>
Together we could break this trap 
<BR>
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
<BR>
Will you walk with me out on the wire `
<BR>
Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
<BR>
But I gotta find out how it feels 
<BR>
I want to know if love is wild, girl I want to know if love is real
<BR>
<BR>


Beyond the Palace semi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
<BR>
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
<BR>
And the boys try to look so hard 
<BR>
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
<BR>
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
<BR>
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
<BR>
In an everlasting kiss
<BR>
<BR>


The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
<BR>
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide 
<BR>
Together Wendy we'll live with the sadness 
<BR>
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
<BR>
Someday girl I don't know when we're gonna get to that place 
<BR>
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
<BR>
But till then tramps like us baby we were born to run
