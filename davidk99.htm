<p>
All over the world there's a lot of decay
<br>
And here comes my friend called DK
<br>
He gives us his voice, he gives us his chords
<br>
To help us unite and stand against the hords

<blockquote>
He's the heart-beat kid
<br>
The drum-beat man
<br>
The slow-mo king
<br>
And we join this man
</blockquote>

<p>
Walking in beauty, walking in balance
<br>
Giving the best of all the chances
<br>
Why not ask the question of beauty
<br>
When all the rest is stuffed in duty

<blockquote>
He's the heart-beat kid
<br>
The drum-beat man
<br>
The slow-mo king
<br>
And we join this man
</blockquote>

<p>
Give him respect and let him fly
<br>
Make the universe a place for him to play
<br>
Join his forces and let yourself down
<br>
Embrace his love that flows around

<blockquote>
He's the heart-beat kid
<br>
The drum-beat man
<br>
The slow-mo king
<br>
And we join this man
