<h3>
<a name="offer">
Notification and Offer
</a>
</h3>
I do not want to receive uninvited solicitations by email (``Junk Email'').
I am unwilling to receive Junk Email
freely because it costs me time and money.
If you send me any Junk Email other than on the terms of the offer set out
in the following nine points,
I will take this to mean that you plan to use
what I offered you without paying for it.
If you ever try to do this I reserve my right to take any action available to
me without further reference to you.
Actions available to me include
taking proceedings against you for negligence or breach of contract,
which may result in substantial damages being awarded against you by a court.
The unauthorized use of my computing facilities
may even be a crime.
<ol>
<li>I offer
to receive all further email from you on the terms set out below.
If you send me any solicitation by email
without my express prior written consent
this will be taken as your acceptance of this offer.
<li>For the purposes of points 3 and 4,
you will be taken to have sent any email sent by any entity
apparently
associated with you for the purpose of sending email solicitations.
<li>You must pay me ten US dollars for each such item of email
that you send me.
<li>You must pay me ten US dollars for each copy of each email
solicitation that you send to anybody or any email address
referred to below, even if you don't send a copy to me. You may
also have to pay other persons as well if they have sent you a
similar offer.
<li>I may join with any of those persons
for the purpose of efficiently collecting your payments.  
<li>You must mail payment
by certified check to me within five
working days of the transmission of the email.
If you do not know where to send payment,
you must state this in the email and give me an easy way to tell you.
<li>Each email item must be uniquely identified,
and each payment must clearly identify the relevant item or items.
<li>You must
tell me your name and full business and residential addresses
in each email message.
<li>I may vary the terms of or terminate this
offer at any time
(even after you have accepted it).
Any new terms will apply to all email you send after you have been
notified of a variation.
