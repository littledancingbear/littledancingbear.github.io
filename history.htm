<p>
Way back in August 1997, I uploaded my first web-site. It was physically located on the server of the university I work for. 

<p>
In those times, the major project was the WWW Virtual Library: Public Health, which I had established together with Lucien Schlosser from Germany. Within 9 months or so, the site had received roughly 20,000 visitors.

<p>
In April 1998, I transferred the site to my own domain name, i.e. www.ldb.org, in order to establish the site as a unique feature on the WWW not necessarily connected to my employer. Unfortunately, Lucien had to move somewhere else and couldn't continue contributing regularly to the WWW Virtual Library Public Health. 

<p>
Since then, I maintain the site and its content myself, i.e. whatever you see on this site, there's only one person who edits all of the 800+ single pages. So, please support me by reporting broken links and other failures you come across. Thanks for your kind support.

www.ldb.org has received 100,000 visitors

<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>October 2000</b></font>
<br>
www.ldb.org has received 200,000 visitors

<p>
Looks like there's exponential growth, eh?

<p>
I don't know what's going on as I haven't made major efforts to "promote" the site. It seems that people drop in and look for stuff they're interested in. The statistics of www.ldb.org tell me that people seem to stay longer on the site as ever before. They seem to stroll around and see what's going on here.

<br>
<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/">The Lancet</a>, one of the most reputable medical journals of the world has published an article on my web-site, which is available online at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol356/iss9237/full/llan.356.9237.dissecting_room.13793.1">http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol356/iss9237/full/llan.356.9237.dissecting_room.13793.1</a>

<p>
<b><font color="#FF0000">31 December 2000:</font></b>
<br>
Well, within the past 12 months, the site received more than 140,000 visitors. At the end of the year 2000, www.ldb.org had a bit more than 240,000 visitors.

<p>
<b><font color="#FF0000">21 April 2001:</font></b>
<br>
We've reached 300.000 visitors.

<br>
Due to my terminal illness, I will not be able to update the entire www.ldb.org domain any longer.

<p>
Thanks for dropping in and taking the time to read this brief report.

<p>
May you always walk in peace, balance and beauty - ldb.
