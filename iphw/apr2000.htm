<br>
The restructuring of WHO has led to the disestablishment of the Division of Health Promotion. There is a new cluster called "Noncommunicable Diseases and Mental Health (NMH)", under which there is a Department called "Health Promotion/NCD Prevention and Surveillance Department (HPS)". Within this Department there is no indication for a Health Promotion Unit. The closest to such a Unit is "Life-course and health", however this refers to age-groups and not to settings as the Ottawa Charter of Health Promotion indicated.
<br>
There are "Cross-Cluster Initiatives" within this Cluster, but none of them refers to Health Promotion. In fact, they refer to bio-medical concepts of prevention and health care.
<br>
In short: it can be assumed that Health Promotion as outlined in the Ottawa Charter has become a dead horse within WHO.
<br>
I would like to offer links to the new organizational structure, but they are not yet available on the WHO server.

<br>
Agenda 21 has a section on <a href=" ../agenda21.htm">human health</a>. This section was written way back in 1992 during the Rio de Janeiro Summit. Here is the text and check how international and national organizations have performed vis-a-vis the objectives set.

<p>
<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">22 April 2000:</font></b>
<br>
It looks like the World Health Organizations is disestablishing its Health Promotion Unit. The restructuring of the WHO organization does not indicate at any cluster that Health Promotion will remain an important unit. On the contrary, reliable sources of WHO indicate that the Head of the Health Promotion Unit has been transferred to "Injury Prevention".

<br>
Here's a <a href="who_00.htm">preliminary organizational chart</a> of the restructuring from 5 April 2000. It does not reflect the latest changes, of course. - Watch this space!

<br>
The <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> issued a report on "Mortality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians" based on data-sets from 1997. This report is <a href="../oz2000.pdf">available here as PDF-file</a>, the size of which is 357KB and it requires Adobe Acrobat Reader which you can <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/alternate.html">
download here for free</a>.
