<b>Comment:</b> The authors use diplomatic language to present some of their critical remarks. Unfortunately, they do not take an in-depth look into <b>health</b> partnerships, but only into those aiming at the prevention of diseases like malaria etc. But that doesn't make their analysis less relevant. If you can read between the lines, there's a lot to read here.
