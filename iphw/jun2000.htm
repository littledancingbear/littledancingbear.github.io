Here's a web-site which is of the different kind regarding globalization and its impact on living and working conditions of people particularly in so-called developing countries. It's the web-site of the Whirled Bank, yep, you've read it correctly, the Whirled Bank which dream is "A world full of poverty". This web-site is satirical, cynical, and therefore very realistic, you hardly find better country-specific data.

Less satirical, but nonetheless realistic is the web-site of "Fifty years is enough", i.e. 50 years of World Bank, IMF, and other global players of finance and profit.

<b>Comment:</b> We find it remarkable that UNDP uses the term "civil" in connection with Indigenous Peoples, as the term "civil" according to <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?db=*&term=civil">Websters Dictionary</a> refers to: "Pertaining to a city or state, or to a citizen in his relations to his fellow citizens or to the state; within the city or state."
