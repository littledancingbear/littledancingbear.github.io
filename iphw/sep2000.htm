<ul type=disc>
<li>
humanitarian, as corruption undermines and distorts development and leads to increasing levels of human rights abuse; 
<li>
democratic, as corruption undermines democracies and in particular the achievements of many developing countries and countries in transition; 
<li>
ethical, as corruption undermines a society's integrity; and 
<li>
practical, as corruption distorts the operations of markets and deprives ordinary people of the benefits which should flow from them."
