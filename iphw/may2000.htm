<a href="http://utip.gov.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas Inequality Project</a> provides access to "movements of inequality in wages and earnings and patterns of industrial changes around the world. Our work so far has emphasized two techniques: the use of Theil's T statistic to compute inequality indexes from industrial data, and a combination of cluster analysis on rates of wage change and discriminant analysis to isolate the principal time patterns in changing wage structures. We apply our techniques to data from the United States, the OECD, and UNIDO, with interesting results for both developed and developing countries."

"What makes some societies healthier than others? One of the most powerful influences on health in developed countries is their level of socioeconomic inequality. The greater the income differences within populations (whether of whole countries or of cities or larger administrative areas within countries), the worse their health. This helps explain why the United States, the richest and most powerful country in the world (spending more than any other on health care), ranks below 25th in the league of countries ordered by life expectancy. Income differences between rich and poor are bigger in the United States than in any other developed nation". The International Health Program of the University of Washington (USA) researches this issue and you can access their web-site offering papers at:

"Is globalization dangerous to our health? When asked about globalization, Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of Great Britain, replied, "There is no alternative." Her reply was shortened to "TINA," which some people think is a newly discovered law of nature. Yet, public resistance to this new corporate-centered trade is increasing. What relevance does this have to American physicians? Does globalization affect health?" - This is an article by Stephen Bezruchka</a>, and it's available here: <a href="http://www.ewjm.com/cgi/content/full/172/5/332">http://www.ewjm.com/cgi/content/full/172/5/332</a>.
