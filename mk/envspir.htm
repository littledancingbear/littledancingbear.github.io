Description
</font>

<p>
Many Native people find it difficult to explain their ways of life, beliefs, traditions, and observations with the word "religion." Like all peoples throughout the world, Native people seek their own way to explain origins and destinies, to face the unknown and learn the power and meaning of natural laws and forces. Religion is an attempt to bring an individual or group closer to the sources of these powers and laws. A study of the world's religions demonstrate that many symbols, ways of teaching, and ways of expressing the sacred, are universally shared by human beings.  Instead of religion, however, Native people prefer the word sacred or spiritual to denote something unseen or intangible; it describes our vision, a collective experience of seeing the world through oral histories, ceremonies, ritual, and customs. 

<p>
Indigenous spirituality is the basis of relationship that Indigenous peoples have with Mother Earth or the environment. The topic of environmental science as a subject related to spirituality is not new.  Unlike those with the western view of science, Native peoples are unable to separate their relationship with the earth and their spirituality or religion.  It is the basis of their lifeways. This course offers learners in the global arena an understanding of the ecological values, spirituality of Indigenous persons, and how these lifeways are impacted in colliding cultures. Because of its web-based format, learners in this course will be involved with learners from anywhere on the planet and especially with Indigenous people throughout the world. Learners will critically examine philosophical issues behind the debates put forth by Indigenous peoples regarding spirituality, environment, and environmental issues.

Module One: 
</font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
Behind the Buckskin Curtain: Science and the Oral Tradition
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
Science and religion are inherited ways of believing certain things about the world.  A good many of our problems today are the result of the perpetuation of dreadfully outmoded beliefs derived from the Near Eastern/European past which do not correspond to what our science is discovering today or to the remembered experiences of non-Western peoples across the globe.  Even in the purest forms of scientific and religious expression are rooted in the unconscious metaphysics of the past, and critical examination of the roots of basic doctrines in these areas will reveal the inadequacy of our beliefs. (Deloria, 1995, pg. 15-16).
</blockquote>

<p>
This Module introduces Indigenous peoples, their lifeways and their relationship to "science".  We understand the role of Native science.  By careful observation, listening, and waiting Indigenous peoples understand the cycles of the earth, the roll of the tides, the times to gather and hunt.  Early native scientists have given us the basis for our own relationships with the environment and with our belief system.  The oral tradition passes those skills on to the next seven generations. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions: 

<p>
How does the First Amendment affect Native religions in the US? What is environmental science? As Western civilization grew to dominate the world it, viewed the natural world as primarily physical matter with little spiritual content.  How does Indigenous science differ? What is Indigenous science? How did reason and revelation split in seeking truth about our universe? How does this split further alienate the philosophies of Indigenous peoples in views of the natural world? Does Native spirituality dovetail with ecological systems theory?

Module Two: 
</font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
Learning from my Grandmothers: Ecosystems and Indigenous spirituality as units of sustainability
</font>

<blockquote>
Everything has its own special place and individuality, is dependent on and shares in the growth and work of everything else. If you take the life of an animal, you have to let that animal know why you are doing so, and take full responsibility for that act.  One reason is a way of showing that you understand the balances that exist in natural systems, or ecology. (Beck, Walters & Franciso, 1977).

<p>
We are made from Mother Earth and we go back to Mother Earth.  We can't own Mother Earth.  We're just visiting here.  We're the Creator's guests. He's invited us to stay for a while, and now look what we've done to his creation.  We've poisoned it; we've made a wreck of it.  He's bound to be mad-and he is. (Leon Shenandoah/ Iroquois).
</blockquote>

<p>
This Module discusses the structures and function of ecosystems and how each ecosystem contributes to the spiritual health of the Indigenous peoples who live there. For example, people of the eastern woodlands depend on birch for smudges, and fish as their cultural food.  People of the plains depend on the sage for their smudges and on bison for their traditional foods.  In Australia, the people needed emus, kangaroos, and turtles for their spiritual health. In this way, each ecosystem keeps the spiritual health of the people. We are seeing the results today in decimated ecosystems and decimated spiritual practices of the people.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
How does science define ecosystems?  What are ecosystems and how do they coincide with Indigenous spirituality beliefs about the earth?  How do Indigenous spiritual beliefs depend on ecosystem sustainability? What happened in the 1850-1920s when governments relocated tribes in the US?  What was the result in Arctic Canada when the Inuit were brought from a hunter gather nation into settlement?  What happens to Spirituality when the tribes leave their ecosystem and learn new ways?  What was the effect on spirituality from the massacres of Australian Aborigines by the Europeans?

Module Three: 
</font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
Evolutionary Prejudice: Indigenous Creation Stories/Christian Myths  
</font>

<p>	
An area of great debate and considerable friction concerns the origins of American Indians.  Europeans believe that the Hebrew God created all humans.  Presuming that all of mankind was represented in Noah's Ark, one could trace a path from Mount Ararat to Siberia to the Bering Strait.  Others could establish the same sequence if Indian people in North America are the "Ten Lost Tribes" of Israel further assuming that they moved east instead of west after Babylonian captivity to help rebuild the temple. (Deloria, 1997). 

<p>
This Module focuses on populations, ecological disturbance, growth curves, genetic mutations, environmental selection, and evolutionary change.  It discusses change through selective breeding, changes in species and ecosystems.  Ultimately linking the topics to issues of creation and spirituality for Indigenous peoples.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
How did the Indigenous people of North America come to be?  Where are their populations centered today?  What relationships do they have with the populations of animals and planted in their home ecosystems? 
What is the conflict among anthropologists' beliefs of human origins and that of Indigenous peoples? 
How do Indigenous peoples view their own origins and the origin of Mother Earth?   
Why do anthropologists think all the Indians are dead? Does the western view of Indigenous Spirituality need to reconstruct ideas of the Savage and pagan rituals?

Living in Two Worlds in a World out of  Balance:  Low Bridge -- Everyone Cross The Bering Land Bridge Theory
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
Our prophecies tell of white people.  They were once our brothers who went away to the East.  They learned all about inventions there.  They were supposed to come back here with inventions and help us to a better life.  They would complete our spiritual circle. But instead of bringing the symbol of the circle, they brought the symbol of a cross.  The circle brings people together; the cross sets them apart.  The cross is a divider.  And that is what they want to do to Indian people.  They want to hang us on a cross of uranium (Thomas Banyaca/Navajo).
</blockquote>

<p>
This Module examines environmental hazards and human health.  We look at links between human health and the environment.  We seek out answers to the issues of water pollution.  We try to comprehend the reasons for targeting Indigenous peoples in toxic economic schemes affecting, mental health, spirituality, tribal lands, and peoples' connections with the earth.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
Why are Tribal lands in the USA, Canada, South America, and Australia targeted by waste disposing companies?  How does waste disposal on tribal land affect Indigenous spirituality?  What is the Rainbow Spirit of Australia's Aboriginal peoples, and how does this spiritual belief protect the land from Uranium mining?  Does Native spirituality protect the people from mining operations in the USA and Canada?  How does the combination of Native spirituality and Native science protect Mi'Kmaq people in New Brunswick, People of the Salmon, and People of the Whale from exploiting resources?

<font size=+1>
Mythical Pleistocene Hit Men: The Beat of the Drum and the Heartbeat of the People
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
Most American Indians, I believe, were here "at the beginning" and have preserved the memory of traumatic continental and planetary catastrophes, keeping the information sometimes in tales deliberately constructed to preserve as well as entertain.  If you visit with an elder, you will get Coyote, Iktomi, and Napi tales that are told in a manner designed to test you.  But if the elder thinks you are serious or you know something of the hidden knowledge then he will begin to tell you what his people have taught for thousands of years giving as closely as possible the literal description of the event. (Deloria, 1995).

<p>
The European invaders never really did understand the spirituality and the cultures of the people they were intruding upon.  Out of deep ethnocentric insensibility, the Europeans then cooked up a scheme that their very presence would result in the conversion of the Powhaten chief to Christianity and allegiance to King James would follow (Sale, 1991).

<p>
As the Western world encroached on Alaska Native territories, the posture of Native people was not unlike that of other Native Americans, to attempt to take the best from the white man's knowledge by acquiring a formal education in the filed of choice, while affirming the Indian spiritual worldview even though there is a significant contrast between western science and Native spirituality and world views (Kawagley, 1999).
</blockquote>

<p>
Human Population is the focus for this module.  We examine immigration and emigration.  We compare birth rates and mortality rates among Indigenous people of Australia and the Native communities of America.   We examine the spiritual view of Indigenous peoples regarding children and population control.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
Why are mortality rates so high among Aboriginal people in Australia?  What is the birth rate for both population?  How are spiritual and cultural lifeways contributing to improved health among Indigenous groups?  Is the destruction of Native spirituality and of their ecosystems an effect of Judeo-Christian lifeways and beliefs?

<blockquote>
Once on Fur Island [Canada] a British bishop who wanted to spite the superstitious Natives who believed they were healed by the milky waters of a limestone, dynamited the white bubbling water that came from the stones.  One of his own priests had been cured of smallpox by these white waters.  The Indians who journeyed there for healing let Christianity pass them by; they refuted a god that made them sick and took away the remedy. (Linda Hogan 1997).

Soils, geology, and renewable resources are the foci for this module.  We examine theories of plate tectonics, forest ecosystem management, and Mountains of Australia, North America and South America sacred sites.  We discuss the concept of geology as ethnicity and spiritual. We describe the role of Indigenous spirituality in matters of geology, water and species conservation.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
Does geology suffer from ethnicity?  How is Indigenous spirituality related to geology?

Wild Species, Biodiversity, and Protection: Are Indigenous Peoples and their Spirituality an Endangered Species
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
Once there was a pact between animals and men.  They would care for one another.  It was an agreement much like the one between land and water.  That pact was broken forced by the need for land and hunger. Dams and mines are going in.  The caribou and geese are affected as are the healing plants needed by the people. (Linda Hogan, 1997).
</blockquote>

<p>
Aborigines (Australia) believe they have believed in Australia since the Dreamtime, the beginning of creation, and archaeological evidence shows the land has been inhabited for over 40,000 years.  Their unifying feature is the belief that the whole universe is alive, that we belong to the land and must care for it. (Mudrooroo, 1994). 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion questions

<p>
Why did Pope John recently declare that all cultures should have their own religion or spirituality?  How does his declaration affect the lives of Indigenous peoples and their spiritual beliefs? As the march of Europeans continues across continents, can his declaration help ensure the survival of Indigenous peoples' lifeways? How do we know that Indigenous people are becoming extinct?  How do we know that Indigenous peoples are adapting to European lifeways?  How does altering spiritual beliefs affect global biodiversity?

<br>
<font size=+1>
The Boundaries of the World
</font>

<p>
The word God is inviting.  The name means to call out, to sing, to summon, or to pray. God was everything beneath my feet, beneath the water; it was in the air, and there was no such thing as empty space. (Linda Hogan 1997).

<p>
Flood stories are prevalent in Indian spirituality. Scholars in comparative religion steer away from the flood stories for demonstrating that all cultures have these kinds of traditions.  The Christians link the flood stories to proof of the accuracy of the Old Testament. Tribal accounts of floods and earthquakes remain separate from ideas of crime and punishment, good and evil (Deloria, 1995). 

<p>
<blockquote>
Long, long ago the Big Horn Basin was a great sea.  Fish and animals and megafauna lived on the shore of the sea and were too smart to be caught by the Indians, so the people were thin and hungry.  Suddenly the water of the great sea began to lower.  The water went so low that the fish were piled on top of one another then the sea disappeared completely and there was nothing left by the great river that roared in a crack of the mountains (Deloria, 1995, p.225).
</blockquote>

<p>
This module focuses on the natural occurrences on earth. We examine atmospheric change, floods, climate change, and other phenomenon as results in a changing environment.  We link these occurrences to religious beliefs and Indigenous spirituality. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
Does science create its own stories to describe the boundaries of the world?  How are they presented as truth?  Are these stories any more real than the stories of Indigenous Peoples?  Why do theories of scientists and Christianity appear more credible than spiritual belief stories of Indigenous Peoples?

Module Nine: 
</font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
Animals, Corn, and other foods as a Cultural & Spiritual Gift
</font>

<p>
The perceptions of nature among Koyukon people of the sub Arctic are aligned on two interconnected levels. The first is empirical knowledge.  The practical challenges of surviving by hunting, fishing, and gathering require a deep objective understanding of the environment and methods for using the resources.  But their perception of the natural environment extends beyond what western sciences define as the empirical levels, into the realm of the spiritual.  An elaborate system of supernatural concepts is used in explaining the environment (Nelson, 1983).

<p>
We focus on how Indigenous agriculture gives spiritual meaning to peoples who care for water, salmon, and food production.  We explore food production, famine, and the spiritual nature of foods.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
How do Indigenous peoples define the body and blood of Indigenous spirituality?  How does cultural food enhance spirituality among Indigenous peoples?

At The Beginning: Genesis

<p>
<blockquote>
We give thanks to the Creator for these fruits of the sea.  We ask a blessing on the food that we eat and on all the generations that follow us down to the Seventh Generation.  May the world we leave them be a better one than was left to us (Harriett Stafleaf Gumbs/Shinnecock). 
</blockquote>

<p>
The spiritual fire of Native peoples is here.  It has not been extinguished.  The spiritual fire beckons the world to come closer, to listen, to learn, and to share in its warmth and comfort and to examine the role of Native spirituality in issues relating to environmental science. 

<p>
In this module we focus on economic development and sustainable communities.  We examine political issues and public policy that affect Indigenous spirituality and relationships to the generations past and to come. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Critical Thinking Discussion Questions

<p>
How has Indigenous spirituality enhanced the concept of sustainable communities?  Have governmental policies and legislation of self determination helped or hindered Indigenous spirituality?  In what specific ways have the Treaties with Indigenous peoples of the US helped or hindered spiritual and economic  development? Do Indigenous people need a revolution to survive their cultural, spiritual, and language loss?
