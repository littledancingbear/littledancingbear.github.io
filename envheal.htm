<p>
<font size="2">
Environment and health have become nearly interchangeable concepts in post-traditional societies. We are able to observe almost an obsession with them, as if individual changes in ways of life - important for the individual and significant for the culture though they may be - possessed the power to overthrow a system of economic relations that aims at growth in numerical terms rather than at development, enabling society to sustain its specific modes of private and public interaction.</p>

<font size=+1><i>Introduction</font></i>
</p>


<p>It is not possible anymore to talk about the environment without referring to health and <i>vice versa</i> (Burger 1990). The environment has become the metaphor for <i>well-being</i> - at least in the industrialized countries suffering from substantial losses of &quot;natural&quot; environments. Densely populated as they are, these countries and their people project the causes of their misery towards <i>the</i> environment. We miss the trees, we fight for each and everyone of them, we want the cows in the meadows and the chicken picking around our houses. Forests, particularly rain-forests, have captured our attention to the limit of psychological competence such that the forests are in danger of becoming the last victims of human kindness after having been already destroyed so extensively. </p>

<p>Environment has become the new buzzword for individual and, particular, sentimental concern. If it was not for the environment, I sometimes think, would there be any other reason to live? Is there any meaning of life without our beloved rain-forests, our frog-highways crossing motorways, our eagles being almost breast-fed if only we could? </p>

<p><i>The</i> environment has taken possession of our emotions; amongst quite a few of us, it has taken control of their souls. We live in times when the meaning of a tree may easily exceed the meaning of human life. Stranded whales receive better media coverage than unemployed people or battered housewives. We are prepared to take <i>real</i> care of the next plant threatened by extinction, but are rather reluctant when it comes to fellow human beings from a foreign country. One may say: since I know the animals (or plants), I hate humans. As much as there is a fundamentalist environmental concern (<i>environmentalism</i>), there is a fundamentalist concern about health (<i>healthism</i>). Both seem to match, both seem to encourage each other. </p>

<p>It seems reasonable to take a closer look at our relationships regarding <i>the</i> environment and health because, sometimes, we behave &quot;stranger than strange&quot; and we seem to lose contact with the history which we, as humans, have built up during the past centuries. I want to address a few issues I feel of particular interest for those working in the areas of environment and health. In order to do this, I will reflect upon our understanding of environment, development and health as ideological constructs helping us to get along with the ways and means our collectivity is dealing with its social organization. Secondly, I want to take a look at the major political and also social discourse of <i>risks</i>, which predetermine our perceptions of the ecological, social, political, economic, and cultural context of society. Thirdly, I wish to introduce a few sociological considerations in order to clarify the issue of environment and health. I will present some ideas on public health referring to such elusive concepts as <i>health promotion</i> and to those agencies which tell us that the future will look bright if we only adopt their political concepts and squeeze them until their assumed pragmatic juice refreshes our individual and collective lives. </p>

<p>
<i><font size=+1>Environment, development and health</font></i>
</p>

<p>Historically, the term <i>environment</i> is a rather new linguistic buzz-word and refers to different sectors of social reality. We speak of social, personal, cultural, economic, political and, of course, biological and physical environments (Bronfenbrenner 1979, Moos 1976). <i>Environment</i>, to a certain extent, has replaced the terms <i>nature</i>, <i>society</i> and <i>community</i>. Ecology has replaced ideology - so it seems (Sachs 1992, Martinez-Alier 1995). </p>

<p>As a political concept, environment is closely linked to the concept of <i>development</i>. Economic growth and technological progress of all kinds are basic approaches of industrialized societies. It is assumed that the development of a society depends on the improvement of the socio-economic conditions, i.e. on economic growth and the improvement of existing, and the invention of new, technologies to <i>rationalize</i> production processes and services. Research and development are key economic sectors of industrialized societies. The production of knowledge and skills to develop, implement and control technologies lies at the heart of these societies. While traditional societies are based on agriculture, <i>post-traditional societies</i> (Giddens 1991) are based on technology and on those traditional societies which provide them with resources of food, raw materials and inexpensive labor.</p>

<p><i>Development</i> refers to two different processes which happen simultaneously: the improvement of socio-economic living conditions in industrialized countries <i>and</i> the political, economic, technological and military control of development in traditional societies (Escobar 1995). The development of industrialized countries is based on lower levels of development in other parts of the world. According to classic economics, <i>development</i> has always been linked to economic growth, and subsequently it has been linked to competition rather than to cooperation. </p>

<ul>
<p>First, mainstream economics has produced flawed theories of economic development for the Third World. Second, these flawed theories imported from the West have lacked fit, resulting in distorted and biased Third World development. Third (...), Western theorists have stubbornly ignored the basic flaws in their theories, hiding these behind idealized constructions of perfect competition or rational (i.e. Western) behaviour. Overall, mainstream economists have failed to realize that underdevelopment may be causally linked to: (i) monopoly profits, externalities, transaction costs and other 'market failures' (...), and above all, (ii) hidden subjective values embedded in these theories themselves (Mehmet 1995, 2-3). 
</p>
</ul>

<p>This condition has become even more important now that environmental degradation in industrialized countries due to pollution, over-population and excessive use of natural resources, has brought forward the notion of environmental protection. In the 1960s and 1970s, environment protection referred to the physical and biological conditions of industrialized countries. The environment of post-traditional societies and nation states was threatened and action had to be taken to preserve their geographical space and the quality of the environment. Environmental policies had to be implemented because war to gain new territories of better environmental qualities was impossible. The Cold War era helped stabilize the global political order as far as post-traditional societies are concerned and forced those societies to implement environmental policies in their respective territories. </p>

<p>Since the Cold War, the situation has changed dramatically. The export of environmentally hazardous production lines, the export of toxic waste, and the expansion of the capitalist economy throughout the world has opened huge potentials for post-traditional societies to improve their survival chances by transferring the costs of environmental protection to developing countries at the same time as pretending that socio-economic development in these countries would improve. While the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 sought the reconciliation of <i>environment</i> and <i>development</i>, Wolfgang Sachs assesses its outcome rather sceptically when he states:</p>

<ul>
<p>To put the outcome of [Rio] in a nutshell: the governments at Rio came around to recognizing the declining state of the environment, but insisted on the relaunching of development ... It is probably no exaggeration to say that the rain dance around 'development' kept the conflicting parties together and offered a common ritual which comforted them for the one or other sacrifice made in favour of the environment. At the end, the Rio Declaration ceremoniously emphasized the sacredness of 'development' and invoked its significance throughout the document wherever possible. Only after 'the right to development' has been enshrined, does the document proceed to consider 'the developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations' (Sachs 1993, 3). 
</p>
</ul>

<p>It was the developing countries at Rio which insisted on their right to establish socio-economic modes of development similar to those prevailing in developed countries. They clearly stated that they were not prepared to control their socio-economic development according to the needs of the developed countries. As the basic economic pattern of development is capitalism as it had been in the case of the developed countries, it can be assumed that environmental degradation in developing countries will take place more rapidly than before and the global environmental condition will worsen accordingly. Arturo Escobar (1995, 44) comments on the effects of this kind of <i>development</i>:</p>

<ul>
<p>Development was - and continues to be for the most part - a top-down, ethnocentric, and technocratic approach, which treated people and cultures as abstract concepts, statistical figures to be moved up and down in the charts of &quot;progress&quot;. Development was conceived not as a cultural process (culture was a residual variable, to disappear with the advance of modernization) but instead as a system of more or less universally applicable technical interventions intended to deliver some &quot;badly needed&quot; goods to a &quot;target&quot; population. It comes as no surprise that development became a force so destructive to Third World countries, ironically in the name of people's interest. </p>
</ul>

<p>Escobar`s comments also apply to developed or post-traditional societies.
The psycho-social and ecological costs of full-blown industrialized societies
are harder to calculate. In terms of individual and collective morbidity
and mortality, we are confronted with an amount of disease and suffering
hardly known to traditional societies. While they are mostly plagued by
communicable diseases, post-traditional societies have developed a new
panorama of non-communicable diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
allergies, etc. All together, the global health situation seems to be horrific,
as the World Health Organization (1992, xiii) states: </p>

<ul>
<p>Serious environmental health problems are shared by both developed and
developing countries, affecting: </p>

<ul>
<li>hundreds of millions of people who suffer from respiratory and other
diseases caused or exacerbated by biological and chemical agents, including
tobacco smoke, in the air, both indoors and outdoors; </li>

<li>hundreds of millions who are exposed to unnecessary chemical and physical
hazards in their home, workplace, or wider environment (including 500,000
who die and tens of millions more who are injured in road accidents each
year). </li>

<li>Health also depends on whether people can obtain food, water, and shelter.
Over 100 million people lack the income or land to meet such basic needs.
Hundreds of millions suffer from undernutrition. </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The sheer number of people affected by the repercussions of <i>development</i>
as economic growth and technological rationalization can make us feel helpless
in respect of the results of the way of life we are leading. In its 1996
<i>World Health Report</i>, WHO (1996) presents a deteriorating picture
of the global health condition particularly emphasizing the recurrence
of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera which seem to
spread all over the world affecting developed and developing countries
alike. It seems that the situation is getting out of control when </p>

<ul>
<p>[r]esistance by disease-causing organisms to antimicrobial drugs and
other agents (has become) a major public health problem worldwide (...)
Resistance has no natural barriers; its development in the most remote
locations can lead rapidly to a worldwide impact, aided by international
air travel (WHO 1996, 18 and 19). </p>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these health problems, developing countries face a number
of social, economic, cultural and political difficulties. Most of these
can hardly be dealt with in short-term development programs. Among others,
they include: </p>

<ul>
<li>health care system, </li>

<li>educational system, </li>

<li>unemployment and under-employment, </li>

<li>inter- and intracountry migration, </li>

<li>rapid urbanization, </li>

<li>public and private transport, </li>

<li>adequate housing, </li>

<li>water and sanitation facilities, </li>

<li>solid waste disposal </li>

<li>energy supply, </li>

<li>food supply, </li>

<li>population growth, </li>

<li>environmental pollution. </li>
</ul>

<p>The economic situation of most developing countries is rather unbalanced;
the national budget is low, often due to difficulties in collecting taxes,
lack of governmental revenues, and rising foreign debt repayments; falling
prices for almost all raw materials offered by these countries; and low
average income per capita. On the other hand, energy costs have gone up
during the past decades so that industrialization is improving only slowly
in many countries. This situation is exacerbated by the lack of vocational
training among many people. The lack of an infrastructure needed to improve
economic growth prevents foreign investors from coming into the country.
Finally, many countries are confronted with unstable political and social
conditions. </p>

<p>
<i><font size=+1>Risk</font></i>
</p>

<p>After humans have engaged in 
industrialization, nothing has been, or
can be the same as before. Traditional societies operated and operate according
to <i>natural</i> conditions like seasons, sunrise and sunset, locally
determined exchange of goods and services, low tide and high tide. Then,
life was determined by natural forces in combination with forces of spiritual
necessities. Religion and traditional belief systems predetermined the
course of everyday-life. The invention of a temporal structure of societal
life is due to the necessity for religious services according to Christian
faith. Zerubavel (1981, 1985) has argued that we would not be able to work
according to specific time-schedules expressed in seconds, minutes, hours,
days, weeks, months, and years without the Catholic Church and its agents.
</p>

<p>While the power of the church utilized the human need for security of
one form or another, it simultaneously operated on the formation of beliefs
and attitudes regarding individual perspectives of life and its meaning
regarding spiritual fulfilment. It was the Catholic Church, for example,
that had no difficulty in ordering the killing of millions of women considered
to be competitors as far as spiritual, mental and physical health was concerned
(Heinersohn et al. 1979). The inquisition sought to establish the superiority
of the experts' spiritual knowledge over women's knowledge of health and
well-being regarding <i>all</i> aspects of health. Several centuries later
in 1946, a consortium of experts, foreshadowing the Constitution of the
World Health Organization, had difficulty defining health in as comprehensive
a way as these women had. The genocide against women in the 15th and 16th
century was not only the beginning of male dominance over <i>all</i> aspects
of well-being, but it also led to the development of a certain type of
philosophy which dominates our thinking even today: mind over matter or,
as the French philosopher, Ren&eacute; Descartes in the beginning of the
17th century stated: <i>cogito, ergo sum</i> (I think, therefore I am).
Subsequently, it created new professions, the most powerful of which are
the medical professions which are still with us and which are still determining
our world-view to an extent never before accomplished by any other profession.
</p>

<p>While health in former times related to the living conditions and ways
of life people had developed over 
the course of time <i>and</i> in the
context of natural rhythms, health now became a matter of <i>scientific</i>
curiosity. The experts had the religious legitimation to invade the human
body, that is, in particular, the female human body, study its physiology,
and investigate ways and means of operating on the body in cases of disease
and (assumed) necessities. The medical profession established itself as
the experts in life and death. They dissociated themselves from the control
of the church and created a separate monopoly of knowledge and practice
which increasingly competed against the spiritual <i>fatalism</i> of Christian
religion by introducing principles of rational <i>pragmatism</i> (Foucault
1994a, 1994b). The conceptual and instrumental development occured simultaneously
with the development of industrialized societies. Both sides acted hand
in hand: while mass production became the preferred mode of the capitalist
economy, the medical profession cleared its broad implementation by gaining
control over bacteria and subsequently, communicable diseases which had
previously evolved as epidemics in densely populated areas. Industrialization
is not possible without sophisticated medical surveillance and monitoring
systems being able to detect anomalies in their earliest stages and treat
them with massive doses of (bio-) chemical substances. However, the reasons
for the successful control of communicable diseases are not the result
of medical inventions and treatment, alone. The improvement of water and
sanitation, housing conditions, nutrition, education, and workplaces contributed
significantly to the establishment of living conditions which have become
almost free of life-threatening epidemics until recently. </p>

<p>The risks embedded in the project of modernity were seen by only few
academics. The vast majority of the population, including economists and
politicians, greeted the socio-economic and technological <i>progress</i>
made as a most welcome expression of their capacities and as an improvement
of their living conditions. Technology became the key vehicle for social
change and was thought to enable even better ways of life in the future.
Until the 1970s, it was almost impossible to publicly discuss the serious
repercussions of technology on the quality of life of the whole population.
The degradation of the environment was seen as a necessary side-effect
of the constant improvement of the socio-economic condition - and there
was deep confidence that technology would be able to find solutions for
the problems it may have created. </p>

<p>With the advent of huge technological complexes of production, safety
and security became an increasingly important issue for those who ran those
facilities and for those who were employed by them and/or lived close to
them. The history of environmental pollution is, of course, longer than
our concern with the environment (Douglas &amp; Wildavsky 1984, Landy et
al. 1994, Schnaiberg &amp; Gould 1994, Sheehan &amp; Wedeen 1993). Only
when pollution had become so prevalent, did we realize what had happened
within our cities, towns and villages: industrialization has constantly
destroyed the biological fundaments of our lives - and we have played a
major part in this process. However, the social and cultural shock which
shook developed societies has not changed the course of development significantly.
New experts arose and explained that there was no cause for panic since
they were able to calculate the <i>risks</i> of technology. Unparalleled
in the history of research, risk analysis, risk assessment and similar
topics became the fastest growing research areas in the 1980s and 1990s.
</p>

<p>The German sociologist, Ulrich Beck (1992), subsequently called developed
societies <i>risk societies</i> because their main approach towards development
is the calculation, and consequently, the control of risks, that is, they
assume they are able to control risk. Seveso, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl
and Bhopal are only the well-known technological disasters of the past
20 years. More significant is the daily breakdown of technological systems
which were supposed to function for decades without interruption. While
risk analysis proves their failure on a day-to-day basis, this has not
lead to the conclusion that the basic assumptions of risk analysis may
be inappropriate or simply wrong. Real life is more complex and uncertain
than mathematical equations are able to swallow. </p>

<p>The sociology of risk tells us, perhaps unintentionally, that all our
scientific concepts and methods are much too simple to comprehend the ecological
systems we live in and the impact of our technological systems on them.
Risk is an abstract category. In real life, we talk of threats and dangers,
but this language seems inappropriate when we think of technological progress.
However, developed societies have become dangerous indeed. They threaten
the global eco-system, and subsequently, they are a significant threat
to human life itself. In the next section I will discuss the implications
of the concept of risk as far as public health is concerned. </p>

<p>
<i><font size=+1>Public health</font></i>
</p>

<p>A few years ago, I found an article in a journal called <i>Healthlinks</i>,
published by the Health Education Authority of Great Britain. It written
by a woman from Glasgow, an industrial center of Scotland. The whole region
had been the subject of economic crises and subsequently deteriorating
living conditions. In order to change her individual living conditions
after having given birth to three children, she got involved in community
organization. Her individual health concerns about her children and herself
changed to become a question of the distribution of wealth. She wrote:
</p>

<ul>
<p>The let's all go jogging, stop smoking and eat brown bread type of health
promotion campaigns have failed to reduce the health inequalities experienced
by people subjected to modern-day poverty. Individualising the problem
and the solution only damages the moral and spiritual health of the nation.
</p>

<p>Modern day poverty is a worse killer than smoking - and it is also passive.
That is why people in my community (i.e. Glasgow -EW) are convinced that
as much passion must be applied to stubbing out poverty as is being applied
to stubbing out smoking. We need homes that are fit to live in and incomes
or benefits that prevent us from having to choose between heating and eating
(McCormack 1994, 10).
</p>
</ul>

<p>This may seem to be a rather strong statement of no particular relevance
to health promotion as she seems to refer to housing and other subjects
supposedly not essential to health. However, Cathy McCormack argues that
health promotion should be concerned with living conditions because her
living conditions were not on an acceptable level health-wise. Cathy argues
that health promotion campaigns which aim at the individual do not make
sense if there is not a basic provision of living conditions adequate for
human beings. Cathy was concerned about her three children and the conditions
she was living in. She thought that those conditions prevented her from
being a good mother to her children; and they prevented her children from
becoming good and healthy children in the first place. </p>

<p>Health is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as physical,
mental <i>and</i> social well-being, and as an expression of trust in the
present and in the future. Health is a universal and simultaneously a specific
indicator for people's <i>experience</i> of the quality of their environment
and the embedded quality of social relations they share. One can say, health
reflects the relations between people and their living conditions, and
thereby looks at both ends of the relations and the processes in between.
If these relations lack positive experiences, they lack trust as well and
<i>vice versa</i>: that is, they lack trust in oneself, trust in significant
others, trust in social support systems, trust in public health policies
and, subsequently they lack trust in society as a whole. </p>

<p>Well-being cannot be thought of without referring to trust. If we cannot
have trust in ourselves, we feel insecure. If we cannot have trust in the
sustainability of the environment, we lose perspective on our lives and
the lives of our children and future generations. If we cannot have trust
in the government, we feel alienated and excluded from the decision-making
regarding our future. Trust is a key category for understanding the construction
of societies. Without trust, we would be a conglomeration of individuals,
more or less ordered to certain interest groups, pursuing our particular
interests in combat against each other about the control of resources.
</p>

<p>Ideally, societies provide us with a frame of reference which guides
not only individual and collective pursuits of interests, but most important,
it sets standards of <i>common weal</i>. Societies are built to enable
people to live together despite their different individual interests. Societies
do not harmonize, they hardly balance these interests but they provide
a framework of values, beliefs, and communicative strategies which binds
people together and gives meaning to their action. Of course, this framework
is subject to change and, accordingly, all social sectors undergo processes
of change. Most importantly, however, trust remains the consistent denominator
of societal processes because without trust, these processes would lead
to the liquidation of the society as a whole. </p>

<p>The societal development of industrialized countries has led to an almost
total destruction of traditional values and belief-systems and the roles
and functions of their respective institutions. Economic and technological
development have simultaneously destroyed traditional social systems because
these traditions have lost their meanings and functions for societal systems
based on the individualization of social relations in <i>all</i> social
sectors and areas. We have lost traditional systems of rationality and
have replaced them with the rationality of technology. We have lost traditional
systems of inter-generational families and have replaced them with the
two-generation family, although an increasing proportion of the population
lives as singles and/or single mothers and fathers. Modern societies have
become post-traditional societies in the sense that they have broken with
traditions to a large extent. </p>

<p>While the metaphor of the <i>self-made man</i> initially referred to
someone who took his economic life in his hand - <i>homo oeconomicus</i>,
it has now become an overall ideal of human life in modern societies (Romanyshyn
&amp; Whalen 1987). Self-realization and self-sufficiency are the core
criteria of success. Human potential has to be developed to the fullest
extent by each individual - so we are told not only by the World Health
Organization which is concerned about the health status of each person
on Planet Earth, but also by educators, psychologists, management trainers,
and ecologists; in short by all the modern priests of personhood and well-being.
A good individual is the totally developed one! What they are really saying
is, a good individual is one which follows our advice. </p>

<p>In post-traditional societies there is no escape from good advice about
all aspects of human life. We are subjected to institutions and agencies
which provide us with an overload of information and advice resulting frequently
in contradictory concepts and measures of alleviating our individual lives.
We have to select the appropriate schools and universities, we have to
buy the adequate garments and perfumes, we have to train our language and
communication skills, we have to eat the right food and watch the politically
correct TV channels, we have to put our money in the right trust funds
and build ecologically sound homes, and so on. Whatever we do, there is
someone &quot;out there&quot; telling us how to do it correctly. </p>

<p>In addition to the governmental bureaucracies which regulate public
and private life in terms of law and order, post-traditional societies
have developed private and public organizations and agencies to design
individual life, guiding it through its course in time, and making sure
that no one falls through the net of the consulting industry. Life cannot
be lived anymore by ourselves, it is lived according to designs prepared
and implemented by public and private agencies. A huge industry has been
developed dealing with these issues, mostly covered up by labels such as
&quot;Do-it-yourself&quot; or &quot;Self-help&quot;. </p>

<p>These labels are not meant seriously, of course. They are euphemisms
because they do not really intend to 
improve our faculties and skills.
Self-help does not mean self-determination, and it certainly does not mean
self-organization or even empowerment of individuals and groups. What the
consulting industry is aiming at is gaining control over individuals and
the potential risks they bear for society in terms of development, creativity,
solidarity, and empowerment through community organization. &quot;Self-help&quot;
has to be understood literally, i.e. just help yourself and do not care
about others or worry about the conditions that might have led to the state
you are currently in. &quot;Do-it-yourself&quot; only means to fix the
things that have been broken by someone else. The focus is on <i>self</i>
and not on <i>help</i>. It is the self as a discrete unit that is targeted,
not the self as a social human being in relation to other human beings.
The consulting industry does not deal with communities or social groups
but with numbers of discrete units sometimes packaged to target audiences
if the issue needs to be transmitted in a relatively short period of time.
</p>

<p>The consulting industry does not let us alone as long as everything
turns out fine and we behave according to the advice we are given. We are
left alone of course, as soon as something goes wrong. The relations between
consultant and client are not characterized by commitment, but by commerce.
As soon as we have accepted the advice, i.e. as soon as the advice has
become an <i>individual property</i> by making it part of our lives, the
responsibilities regarding the effects of acting accordingly are ours.
Once we start to jog, the heart failure is ours. It takes time for the
consulting industry to find out whether its advice is sound. Until then
- whenever that may be, because more and more frequently we are not able
to deliver unequivocal research, we have to bear the risks though the consultants
initially claimed they knew that we would only improve if we behaved according
to plan. </p>

<p>Good advice has always been given to people. Parents, friends, neighbors,
colleagues, etc. have always told us to take care of ourselves and avoid
falling into this or another trap. Giving advice is an integral part of
<i>social relationships</i> because it is an expression of the commitment
we feel to significant others. The difference between this type of advice
and the advice provided by the consulting industry lies in the quality
of the relationships between both sides. Social relationships are characterized
by a strong personal responsibility for individual action. Client relations
between us and the consultants are characterized by the interests of the
consultants to lead us on <i>their</i> paths of life. Social relations
are characterized by trust, client relations by efficiency. Social relations
have a long-term perspective, client relations are short-term, issue- and
outcome-oriented. Social relations are necessary to build communities and
societies through solidary action, client relations are designed to fix
&quot;problems&quot;. Social relations are based in the context of everyday
life, client relations are grounded in artificial settings of professional
expertise. </p>

<p>In traditional societies, societal and social processes worked through
the whole community. In post-traditional societies, these processes are
designed by functionaries and experts and are implemented subsequently
according to target audiences and target areas, i.e. to segments of the
social systems without intending in the first place to give people a say
in the development. Post-traditional societies have individualized human
life by disembedding the individual from her reference groups and treating
her as a discrete unit in relation to her social functions. This has not
been a one-way process without any friction and antagonism, and it has
never been accomplished according to plan. Individuals cannot be organized
and controlled the way post-traditional societies have intended. Despite
the prevalence of a consulting industry, individuals have been and will
be unpredictable as regards their actions. This is particularly true with
regard to all social areas such as education, health, intimate relationships,
entertainment, recreational activities or the entire leisure sector. </p>

<p>Post-traditional societies have undergone major changes in terms of
economic policies, technological development, international relations (globalization),
and environmental degradation. While huge wealth has amassed at home, poverty
and hunger have increased abroad in so-called developing countries. While
excelling in developing and implementing more and more sophisticated technologies
at home, almost barbaric conditions prevail in &quot;developing countries&quot;.
Post-traditional societies are arbitrary in essence. Their effects on a
global as well as a regional and national level are antagonistic, to say
the least. </p>

<p>When we take a look at the internal changes of post-traditional societies,
we notice rapid processes of destruction of values, beliefs, roles, responsibilities,
education, families, etc., and almost simultaneous processes of constructing
new ways of dealing with the effects of societal processes on the human
level. </p>

<p>From a social-cultural point of view, three processes of conceptual
construction in relation to social issues 
characterize post-traditional
societies: </p>

<p>1. <i>Medicalization</i>: Post-traditional societies interpret
social issues as social <i>problems</i> which need to be dealt with by
professionally trained experts. In order to assign experts to &quot;problem-solving&quot;,
the &quot;problems&quot; have to be formulated in terms of the experts'
knowledge base. For example, social issues like values, family life, education,
public health or nutrition are translated into categories of sociology,
psychology, social work and medicine. The public discourse about these
issues is translated into an experts' discourse <i>addressing</i> the public.
In effect, the public discourse is replaced by an experts' discourse taking
place in public. The public is reduced to interest groups claiming to represent
the public or at least considerable segments of the public. </p>

<p>Expressions of everyday life are interpreted in the light of analytical
categories of social and medical 
sciences. Everyday life itself loses its
pragmatic, frequently trivial character and becomes a highly sophisticated
issue which needs scientific input to be understood and changed. Human
expressions of love, passion, anger, anxiety, enjoyment or lust are decontextualized
and deprocessualized into frozen categories of psycho-, medico- and socio-analysis.
These analytical categories are used as representations for complex and
often complicated psychological, sociological and cultural processes. For
example, the term depression is assigned to a variety of decontextualized
behaviors thereby leading to the epidemiological statement that depressions
are prevalent in post-traditional societies. When defining certain behavior
as depressive, we are able to identify the behavior accordingly without
needing to question whether the definition is reasonable or valid in the
first place. A second example: by the US-catalogue of psychiatric disorders,
youth from the age of 10 to 14 years are defined as mentally unstable and
psychiatrically ill when they do not obey their parents. Here, the social
relationships of the family are translated into psychiatric categories
thereby indicating that the family suffers from &quot;problems&quot; and
that the &quot;cause of this problem&quot;, namely the child, needs professional
treatment in order to fit into the set of psychiatric categories of mental
health again. Finally, a third example: </p>

<p>The conceptual circle stabilizes the social system as well as the role
of experts - and in the end, it tends to make individual and collective
behavior consistent with the categories rather than constructing categories
to become consistent with behavior. However, this is typical of any process
of scientification: the objects of concern are shaped according to categories
in order to make them fit with the theories the categories are based upon.
As far as health-related issues are concerned, I call this process medicalization
of everyday life and I join Peter Conrad when he states: </p>

<ul>
<p>With medicalization, medical definitions and treatments are offered
for previous social problems or natural events; with healthicization, behavioral
and social definitions are advanced for previously biomedically defined
events (e.g. heart disease). Medicalization proposes biomedical causes
and interventions; healthicization proposes lifestyle and behavioral causes
and interventions. One turns the moral into the medical, the other turns
health into the moral (Conrad 1992, 223). </p>
</ul>

<p>2. <i>Therapeutization</i>: It is only logical that after the
medicalization of social issues, the solution to the defined problems lies
in their therapeutization, i.e. in experts' knowledge and skills of problem-solving
as regards individual and collective behavior. Again, it is assumed that
experts know how to solve social problems because they are trained professionally
to understand human thoughts and behavior and to be able to change human
thoughts and behavior according to set objectives. </p>

<p>Therapeutization means the scientification of everyday life in terms
of psycho-technological treatment potentials, i.e. behavior modification.
We have become subjected to experts' insight and techniques regarding our
psyche. We are what we are defined for, so it seems. We are no more what
we believe we are or we may be able to be. The human potential gets streamlined
according to socially preferred and psycho-technologically feasible types
of personality development. The social and cultural images and meanings
of the human body are but one example. </p>

<p>3. <i>Judicialization</i>: In order to legitimize the role of
experts in the process of problem-definition and problem-solving, the problems
themselves have to be translated into judicial terms. Legislation of social
problems takes place to an extent never seen before. The <i>behavioral</i>
control via laws is the key characteristic. The law is a strong control
agent of individual and collective behavior in as much as it is perceived
as the general behavioral and cognitive guideline of the societal framework
of public and private life. Yet, it only presents the <i>formal</i> framework
of social relations pressing these relations into judicially manageable
mechanisms. </p>

<p><i>Judicialization</i> refers to the incapability of the political system
to open up public discourses on topics of societal relevance. The institution
of the political discourse is given up in favor of a judicial one, thereby
assuming that the judicial system would be capable to come up with sound
regulatory answers to problems that have not yet been discussed in-depth
publicly. In the end, the judicial system will have no other option but
to refuse the presumptions of the political system and to reject the idea
that social problems can be resolved by setting judicial standards of resolution.
In the end, we are confronted with a vicious circle which prolongs our
insecurity rather than resolving it. </p>

<p>Epidemiology teaches us about the distribution of mortality and morbidity
across an entire population. Mortality rates, surprisingly, do not change
very much in the course of time. In fact, they almost stay the same. A
certain percentage of the population dies every year irrespective of what
safety measures are taken. What may change is the distribution of deaths
among age groups. With morbidity, the case is only slightly different.
We observe changes in patterns of morbidity, but we do not observe significantly
higher or lower rates of morbidity over the course of time. Populations
seem to suffer and to die rather predicably as soon as they have reached
a certain level of socio-economic development. The developed countries
of the world, for example, have not suffered from substantial changes in
their mortality and morbidity over the past 30-50 years. </p>

<p>This is amazing given the changes in medical technology and the level
of public awareness concerning health-hazardous behaviors. What have changed,
are certain causes of death as demonstrated in death certificates and certain
distributions of so-called premature deaths among particular age groups.
The overall epidemiological picture, however, stays almost the same. </p>

<p>There are few issues related to these changes on death certificates.
Death certificates have become more precise in the course of time because
physicians have more knowledge and skills to determine at least some causes
of death. In addition, many deaths are investigated by pathological services.
However, since death happens when physiological systems shut down, physicians
tend to refer to individual causes of death according to their medico-technological
education. That is, many deaths are classified, for example, as caused
by cancer or cardiovascular deficiencies. If death certificates were taken
seriously, in the end everybody would be classified as dying of cardiovascular
arrest, because the heart will stop beating at some point in time. The
notion of cancer in a polluted environment does not seem meaningful at
all when it only refers to potential individual behavior. </p>

<p>Cancer has become one of the most prominent causes of death related
to &quot;individual malbehavior&quot;. In a society which promotes such
behavior via <i>consumerism </i>and adjacent campaigns of product promotion
and which does not take care of occupational health and safety, building
codes, environmental protection standards etc., cancer will always be one
of the major causes of death among a population which simply grows too
old because of these developed living conditions. Cancer is hardly an indicator
of &quot;misbehavior&quot; but is an indicator of the level of socio-cultural
development of post-traditional societies in addition to the quality and
range of pathological investigations. </p>

<p>We are talking about a paradox, maybe even a dilemma: developed societies
in uncontrolled ways have gone so far that individual life can be extended
to limits never experienced before but simultaneously threatening collective
lives in pursuit of their economic prosperity by establishing modes of
production, manufacturing, housing codes, environmental pollution and living
standards hazardous to the health of the population rather than to the
health of particular individuals. </p>

<p>Mortality among age groups demonstrates the inhumane social, cultural
and physical environment developed countries have established. In the USA,
most deaths of young people under or at 25 years of age are traffic and
drug-related and among African-American youth of the same age group, murder
ranks number one of the causes. Mortality and morbidity in these cases
simply reflect societal developments rather than effects of individual
and collective risk-behaviors. </p>

<p>The relation between sick populations and sick individuals has been
noted by the late British epidemiologist Geoffrey Rose in his book <i>The
Strategy of Preventive Medicine</i>. He brings to focus the key problem
of epidemiology by stating: </p>

<ul>
<p>If a small amount of alcohol slightly impairs a driver's judgement,
then the large number of drivers who have had one or two drinks would collectively
incur a large excess of accidents, even though none of them individually
had an obvious problem, but current policy assumes that this is not the
case (Rose 1992, 86) </p>
</ul>

<p>Geoffrey Rose has been principal investigator of the <i>Whitehall-Study</i>,
a long-term 
epidemiological study of morbidity and mortality of employees
of the civil service of the Parliament of England. This is probably the
best documented study ever regarding the substance of epidemiological data
in relation to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The research
reports generated from this study can be summed up by as follows: </p>

<ul>
<p>Low income is related to poorer housing, poorer diet, fewer social amenities,
worse working conditions. (...) After adjustment for age, sex, race, smoking,
alcohol consumption, sleep habits, leisure-time physical activity, chest
pain, diabetes, or cancer, there was still an increase risk of 1.6 for
those with inadequate incomes (Rose 1992, 86) </p>
</ul>

<p>Health and death do not seem to be a matter of individual choice of
certain behaviors over others. There is more to life and death than just
the question of what you eat and if you exercise. It is questionable to
link particular behaviors to certain death causes. It becomes more questionable,
the more we realize that societies are extremely complex systems linked
to other societies - and that the environment is a much more basic layer
of human development, full of ecological, i.e. systemic qualities not being
matched by the societal mechanisms we have developed during the past centuries
(Marmot et al. 1987, Wilkinson 1986). </p>

<p>In terms of public health, the understanding of society is a crude one.
Health professionals seem to believe societies to be an external frame
of individual life and individual life to be external to society. Epidemiological
studies and reports on public health rarely reflect the dialectic relations
between individual and society, let alone the complexity of the interdependence
between societies, between cultures, between social groups, and between
individuals. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that contemporary public health does not have
a concept of comparative analysis regarding its subject. Disease and its
development is related to individual behavior irrespective of its cultural
context. Cardiovascular diseases, for example, are studied in relation
to individual behavior classified as risk-factors: smoking, cholesterol
level, blood pressure, physical exercise, etc. No suggestion is made that
risk-factors may be mathematical clusters of vital social and cultural
factors being differently shaped and being of different relevance in different
societies and for different people. Risk-factor medicine has become the
prevalent concept of public health. </p>

<p>The disease-orientation of public health is not able to comprehend that
life follows different, unpredictable paths of direction and meaning. It
is only able to understand that life needs to be controlled in terms of
questionable physiological parameters and the subsequent necessity of adjusting
the body accordingly, without giving an idea how disease may be caused
and health may be achieved in culturally sensitive ways. This type of prevailing
public health has no idea of the social and cultural connotations of risk,
let alone of the individual, collective, interactive and contextual dimensions
of personality development. </p>

<p>
<i><font size=+1>Conclusion</font></i> 
</p>

<p>Environment and health have become 
nearly interchangeable concepts in
post-traditional societies. We are able to observe almost an obsession
with them, as if individual changes in ways of life - important for the
individual and significant for the culture though they may be - possessed
the power to overthrow a system of economic relations that aims at growth
in numerical terms rather than at development, enabling society to sustain
its specific modes of private and public interaction. From the point of
social change, it does not make much difference whether one engages in
one or the other arena. Both are weak players in political terms, and both
are currently so diverse in concepts and strategies that they do not present
a substantial threat to the established political and economic system.
</p>

<p>In times of economic crisis, or even transition, which the post-traditional
societies are currently confronted with, a completely new frame of mind
as regards further development might be appreciated by some. Those in power
do not seem to like the idea of substantial change at all. Social movements,
the latest hope of some political analysts, still have to prove that they
are able to sustain their energy over a long period of time characterized
by slow change, conflictuous industrial relations, rising under- and unemployment,
and increasing nationalism or even racism. These are not conditions supportive
for the changes needed. </p>

<p>As regards scientific ideas on environment and health, I believe that
we still depend too often on our old 
frames of mind. Rationality in the
sense of the past centuries has brought us to the point where we are currently.
A philosophy which conceptualizes vivid processes as sequences of end-points
does not seem to be prepared to comprehend the complexity of ecological
systems of which we humans are only one element. Gregory Bateson (1980)
in terms of epistemology, and Paul Feyerabend (1993) in terms of methodology
presented new ideas which may enable us to face our global problems as
expressions of our ways of life rather than as a set of mathematical calculations.
</p>

<p>However, beyond all needs for conceptual changes lies an even more difficult
task: environment and health are not isolated arenas of political dispute.
They are part of a comprehensive system of local, regional, national, and
international interdependencies of political and economic power structures.
We are not alone anymore, if we have ever been. Whatever happens somewhere
on this planet, it will have an impact on our individual and communal living
conditions and on the ways how we see the world. We are on our way although
nobody knows where the journey will lead us. However, one thing is crystal
clear: </p>

<ul>
<p>The almost insoluble task is to let neither the power of others, nor
our own powerlessness, stupefy us (Adorno 1974, 57) </p>
