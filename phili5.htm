remarkable events before, during, and since the climactic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, to 
synthesize those observations into an understanding of Pinatubo as a dynamic, complex

observations and interpretations accessible to volcanologists around the world, especially 
those who must cope with similar crises in the future"

But that's not enough. You must go through the painful, yet, rewarding experience of becoming one who knows and believes in Pinoy. This completes our  task of delivering you the Pinoy stuff daily"
