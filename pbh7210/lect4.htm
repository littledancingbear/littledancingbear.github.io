Introduction
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
Little Dakota lay on soft caribou robes, his black eyes open wide in the darkness of his family's cedar lodge.  His grandmother, a tribal medicine woman, sits close stroking Little Dakota's long black hair.  As she strokes, she sings softly to the Creator.  Little Dakota's soft brown skin is as hot as the rocks at noon on a summer day.  Next to his grandmother, nestled in a pearly shell, is the cedar bark smudge.  The smoke rises to the top of the cedar lodge and encircles Little Dakota's feverish body.  His grandmother prays to the spirits of the four directions.  As she prays, she moves the smoke in the direction of the rising sun, to the lands of the coyote, the south, the west and the north. She sings her medicine song in her own tribal language.  It is the time before contact with the Europeans.  Tomorrow Little Dakota's eyes will be bright once more and he will run and play warrior games with his friends.  He will be well and pain free, healed by the Creator's power and his grandmother's song. (Colomeda, 1999)
</blockquote>

<p>
In our Great Grandmother's time, healing and health was linked to healthy culture and health of the land.  There was a balance maintained among the four elements of the Medicine wheel or the four directions: Physical, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual.  We will learn more about the Medicine Wheel as we concentrate on culture and the land as links to ceremonies, wisdom, spiritual animals and healing plants.

<p>

<p>
The colors within the Medicine Wheel are significant. 

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Yellow signifies the East and the rising sun, 
<li>
Red represents the West with the setting sun, 
<li>
the North is represented by the color White, 
<li>
and the Black represents the South.  
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are the four directions.  When Indian people pray, we pray to the four directions; when we seek health we seek balance within the four directions.  Our lives are lived within a circle, the circle of life, the circle of the seasons, the circle of the day. Sometimes you may see and Indian person wearing a circle of beads on the wrist.  Each bead is one of the colors of the Medicine Wheel.  Each bracelet is a prayer. 

<p>
The words that our elders use to describe illness and health are representative of the circle of the Medicine Wheel as well.  For example one of our elders describes how he seeks health. 

<p>
"I go to the sweat lodge. The sweat lodge is a circle of willow.  The entrance faces east."

<p>
It is said by some elders that European people are linear in their thought process; Indian people think in a circle. One of the first things the European missionaries did was discredit the Medicine Healers and shaman.  This seizure of power from the medicine people interrupted a traditional approach to holistic healing (Minor 1992) even though medicine people in Indigenous cultures have had success in treating illness for centuries.

<p>
Today, Indian [and Indigenous] people are faced with a number of health-related problems.  Many of the old ways of diagnosing and treating have not survived the migrations and the changing ways of life for the people.  Skills have been lost. Modern health care facilities are not always available. (Spector 1991, 243).

<p>
But the one remaining constant is our history, our stories, our songs, the Medicine Wheel and the Four Directions.

Thanksgiving Address
</font>

<p>
Greetings to the Natural World

<p>
The People

<p>
Today we have gathered and we see that the cycles of life continue. We have been given the duty to live in balance and harmony with each other and all living things. So now, we bring our minds together as one as we give greetings and thanks to each other as people.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Earth Mother

<p>
We are all thankful to our Mother, the Earth, for she gives us all that we need for life. She supports our feet as we walk about upon her. It gives us joy that she continues to care for us as she has from the beginning of time. To our mother, we send greetings and thanks.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Waters

<p>
We give thanks to all the waters of the world for quenching our thirst and providing us with strength. Water is life. We know its power in many forms-waterfalls and rain, mists and streams, rivers and oceans. With one mind, we send greetings and thanks to the spirit of Water. 
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Fish

<p>
We turn our minds to the all the Fish life in the water. They were instructed to cleanse and purify the water. They also give themselves to us as food. We are grateful that we can still find pure water. So, we turn now to the Fish and send our greetings and thanks.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Plants

<p>
Now we turn toward the vast fields of Plant life. As far as the eye can see, the Plants grow, working many wonders. They sustain many life forms. With our minds gathered together, we give thanks and look forward to seeing Plant life for many generations to come.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Food Plants

<p>
With one mind, we turn to honor and thank all the Food Plants we harvest from the garden. Since the beginning of time, the grains, vegetables, beans and berries have helped the people survive. Many other living things draw strength from them too. We gather all the Plant Foods together as one and send them a greeting of thanks.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Medicine Herbs

<p>
Now we turn to all the Medicine herbs of the world. From the beginning they were instructed to take away sickness. They are always waiting and ready to heal us. We are happy there are still among us those special few who remember how to use these plants for healing. With one mind, we send greetings and thanks to the
Medicines and to the keepers of the Medicines.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Animals

<p>
We gather our minds together to send greetings and thanks to all the Animal life in the world. They have many things to teach us as people. We are honored by them when they give up their lives so we may use their bodies as food for our people. We see them near our homes and in the deep forests. We are glad they are still here and we hope that it will always be so.
Now our minds are one

<p>
The Trees

<p>
We now turn our thoughts to the Trees. The Earth has many families of Trees who have their own instructions and uses. Some provide us with shelter and shade, others with fruit, beauty and other useful things. Many people of the world use a Tree as a symbol of peace and strength. With one mind, we greet and thank the Tree life.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Birds

<p>
We put our minds together as one and thank all the Birds who move and fly about over our heads. The Creator gave them beautiful songs. Each day they remind us to enjoy and appreciate life. The Eagle was chosen to be their leader. To all the Birds-from the smallest to the largest-we send our joyful greetings and thanks.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Four Winds

<p>
We are all thankful to the powers we know as the Four Winds. We hear their voices in the moving air as they refresh us and purify the air we breathe. They help us to bring the change of seasons. From the four directions they come, bringing us messages and giving us strength. With one mind, we send our greetings and thanks to the Four Winds.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Thunderers

<p>
Now we turn to the west where our grandfathers, the Thunder Beings, live. With lightning and thundering voices, they bring with them the water that renews life. We are thankful that they keep those evil things made by Okwiseres underground. We bring our minds together as one to send greetings and thanks to our Grandfathers, the Thunderers.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Sun

<p>
We now send greetings and thanks to our eldest Brother, the Sun. Each day without fail he travels the sky from east to west, bringing the light of a new day. He is the source of all the fires of life. With one mind, we send greetings and thanks to our Brother, the Sun.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
Grandmother Moon

<p>
We put our minds together to give thanks to our oldest Grandmother, the Moon, who lights the night-time sky. She is the leader of woman all over the world, and she governs the movement of the ocean tides. By her changing face we measure time, and it is the Moon who watches over the arrival of children here on Earth. With one mind, we send greetings and thanks to our Grandmother, the Moon.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Stars

<p>
We give thanks to the Stars who are spread across the sky like jewelry. We see them in the night, helping the Moon to light the darkness and bringing dew to the gardens and growing things. When we travel at night, they guide us home. With our minds gathered together as one, we send greetings and thanks to the Stars.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Enlightened Teachers

<p>
We gather our minds to greet and thank the enlightened Teachers who have come to help throughout the ages. When we forget how to live in harmony, they remind us of the way we were instructed to live as people. With one mind, we send greetings and thanks to these caring teachers.
Now our minds are one.

<p>
The Creator

<p>
Now we turn our thoughts to the creator, or Great Spirit, and send greetings and thanks for all the gifts of Creation. Everything we need to live a good life is here on this Mother Earth. For all the love that is still around us, we gather our minds together as one and send our choicest words of greetings and thanks to the Creator.

<p>
Now our minds are one.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Closing Words

<p>
We have now arrived at the place where we end our words. Of all the things we have named, it was not our intention to leave anything out. If something was forgotten, we leave it to each individual to send such greetings and thanks in their own way.
Now our minds are one.
