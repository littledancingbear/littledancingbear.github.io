<p>
At the point of European contact, Indigenous Peoples lived in societies organised by complex kinship systems and well defined rules of marriage, behaviour and interaction. To maintain social cohesion and good order, elders or traditional healers held positions of authority in the group and acted as teachers, judges and spiritual leaders. As in other Indigenous cultures, the traditional healer played a major role in the community to determine the types of behaviour that were correct and permissible.

<p>
Traditional medicine involved lore, education and health, all encompassed in a rigid structure of health, spirituality and well being. Indigenous people were governed by principles and values that determined their cultural obligations and responsibilities, any breach of which often lead to admonishment or severe penalty.

<p>
Intrinsically linked to spirituality and land, Indigenous clans held a deep connection to their 'country' and 'sacred sites' carrying out rituals and obligations to protect them. Aborigines did not possess the land, the land possessed them, and it was not perceived in economic terms. Land was occupied local by groups in perpetuity and this was legitimized in myth, ritual and the accomplishment of responsibilities. Management of land was inextricably linked to rights and responsibilities set out in traditional lore and expressed in the complex matrix of interaction and custom. 

<p>
Traditional approach to illness emphasised the social, spiritual and environmental dimensions of the world in which they lived, all entwined and mutually dependent factors of life. Socialised at an early age into prescribed tasks and responsibilities, Indigenous people embraced a way of life that saw them spiritually at one with the land, the Creator.

<p>
Driven by a system of environmental management, division of labour, resource exchange and trade, traditional Indigenous culture was based on a sophisticated economy which embraced reciprocity and family as opposed to the accumulation of possessions and wealth. Traditional Indigenous society was proud, independent and interdependent on people, environment and spirituality to survive.

Colonisation - Contact and economic erosion
</font>

<p>
The arrival of Europeans in 1788 and the subsequent declaration of Terra Nullius was to change the life of Indigenous societies forever, leaving in place a history of acculturation, disempowerment, discrimination, neglect and poverty.

<p>
Depicted as an unintelligent, paganistic and animal-like species, social doctrines of the day legitimised the subjugation and murder of Indigenous people, separation of families, dispossession of land and the exploitation of their labour to assist with the progress of colonisation. Removed from their homelands without negotiation or treaty, no reference was made to the prior occupation of Indigenous peoples in colonial legislation, thereby establishing a history flawed by omission and stealth. It was a history of the victor.

<p>
The objective of this lecture is to analyse the development of Indigenous poverty in Australia together with the history of influences that have impeded social and economical well being.

Inequality in Australia: Aboriginal impoverishment and institutional influences in contemporary society.
</font>

<p>
Trouble exists when a group defines a social condition as threatening to its values. A critical emphasis means revealing how these groups act to maintain and enhance their privileged state, thereby creating problems for other social groups of people.

<p>
Such is the basis for Indigenous experiences following colonisation.

<p>
Non Indigenous Australians have dominated and exploited the Australian continent for the past 210+ years without recognition of the prior existing title to the land and the importance land held for the Indigenous system of government, lore, customs and religion (Hazelhurst, 1987). It was a widely recognised fact, by both colonisers and British colonial officers in the early stages of occupation, that to deprive the Indigenous people of the land on which they were born was to destroy the economic, social and cultural fabric on which their society was based (Reynolds, 1987).

<p>
Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the notion of Terra Nullius was adopted and embraced by Australian legal and political systems, and accepted unchallenged by non-Indigenous historians (with the exception of a few) to justify dispossession land owned and occupied for over 40,000 years. The gap between law and reality, law and colonial experience grew progressively wider (McConnochie, Hollingsworth & Pettman , 1982).

<p>
Poor health, social, political, moral, psychological and financial ill being, are all intrinsically linked to a history of dispossession, cruelty and conflict in Australia.  Promoted as a country established on ideals of democracy and subsequent multi-culturalism, Australia has prided itself on being accepting of all, regardless of race, creed or social background. An analysis of the historical foundation of Australia refutes this account and reveals a vastly different picture for Indigenous people.

<br>

<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Institutional racism - welfare and social control
</font>

<p>
Institutional control helps to marginalise the poor and hinder their access to appropriate resources and services.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Police, judiciary and law
</font>

<p>
The judicial system in Australia has failed to recognise essential and substantive similarities in the situations of Indigenous people in Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America. All legal systems are based on British common law but of the four nations, Australia is the only nation not to give recognition to the Indigenes pre-existing title of land.

<p>
Indigenous Australians are over-represented in the prison system and juvenile detention centres. Reasons for rates of imprisonment are complex and embedded in the cycle of disempowerment. They include low socio-economic status, lack of employment, alcohol and substance abuse, family violence, and a deficiency in police and judicial system's understanding of Indigenous cultural issues. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Education
</font>

<p>
Education contributes directly to all people's quality of cultural, economic and political life. Education is only one area where Indigenous people want equity and reconciliation. The Hughes Report describes Indigenous people as the most educationally disadvantaged in Australia…Aborigines numbered six times the national average unemployed…when employed [they earn] only half the income of other Australians (Smith, 1995:22). 

<p>
Many suffer from low self-esteem as a result of the racist and sexist attitudes to which they are exposed in the school environment where often they are subject to racist taunts.. A history of segregation and alienation in schools has lead to low education standards, high drop out rates and hence to Indigenous poverty. Intellectual assessment based on ethnocentric values causes Indigenous children to be labeled as slow and unintelligent while a lack of cultural appropriateness in learning techniques and styles has contributed to the Indigenous child feeling ostracized in the school system.  The Eurocentric account of history in textbooks and expressions such as "first settlers" "Burke and Wills were the first men to set foot in this country" thereby negating the existence of Indigenous occupiers of the land, lead to feelings of alienation among Indigenous children and perpetuate stereotypes. Because in many cases, Indigenous children lack role models both in education and employment, the cycle is perpetuated.
