Indian Health Service (IHS)
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
"The rise of anti-Indian legislation [in the US] aimed at the abrogation of treaty responsibilities and the decline of health care dollars, threaten the future of health care in Indian Country. While dollars are declining, the population is rising and becoming more urban.  More than half, 56%, of American Indians and Alaska Natives live in urban areas." (Norrell 1998, C-1).
</blockquote>

<p>
Since the first treaties with Indian Nations in 1784, the Congress of the US government acknowledged some responsibility for the health of the Indigenous people of the USA. In 1802, this sense of responsibility resulted in medical care when the army officers from the US War Department began treating contagious diseases such as smallpox among the Indians living near the military posts. Therefore it seemed plausible to the US government that health care for Indians should fall under The War Department. 

<p>
When smallpox epidemics surged in the 1830s, the government guaranteed to provide health care and education to Indian people in exchange for Indian lands. It was also during that time the US Supreme Court decided that the Indian people should be wards of the government and the government would act as guardians to the Indian people (Brice, 1997).  

<p>
In 1849, The Bureau of Indian Affairs was established and took control for Indians away from the military. 

<p>
<blockquote>
"In 1880, an Army doctor at Pine Ridge Reservation in Pine Ridge Reservation, dispensed medicines to thousands of Cheyenne and Sioux (Lakota) after 'cursory examinations' made through a hole in his office wall" (Brice 1997, 26). 
</blockquote>

<p>
Based on treaty obligations, Congress passed the first Indian health care legislation in 1921 called the Snyder Act.  The Snyder Act authorized [through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)] Congress to appropriate money from "time to time" for the "relief of stress and the conservation of health of American Indians." 

<p>
IHS was a department of the US government set up under the War Department in the 1950s to provide Indian people with health access, to treat the disease that initially resulted from European contact

<p>
In 1954, The Transfer Act transferred responsibility for Indian Health from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Public Health Service and lead to the creation of the Indian Health Service in 1955 (Norrell, 1998).

<p>
Since 1955, the U.S. Public Health Service, through its Indian Health Service (IHS) component, has had the responsibility of providing comprehensive health services to American Indians and Alaska Native people in order to elevate their health status to the highest possible level.   The mission of the IHS is to provide a comprehensive health services delivery system for America Indians and Alaska Natives with the opportunity for maximum tribal involvement in developing and managing programs to meet their needs (Trujillo 1995, i).

<p>
Today Indian Health Service is under the US Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Public Health which has the responsibility for providing health care for all Indian people. Today, many of the staff includes native physicians, social workers, and nurses.  Indian Health Services provides scholarships and training for Indian people who want to enter health care professions.  How did we get to that point?  From an infant mortality of 22 per 1000 births to what it is today?

<p>
Much of this success is due to two Acts of Congress:

<ul type=disc>
<li>
The Indian Self-Determination Act and Education Assistance Act of 1975. This Act was designed to give tribes control over education, spirituality, and health.
<li> 
The Health Care Act of 1976. This Act was intended to elevate the health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives to a level equal to that of the general population through a program of authorized higher resource level in the IHS budget.
</li>
</ul>	

<p>
In 1975 The Indian Self Determination Act was passed by the US Congress to give Indian people freedom of religion, freedom to manage our own education, our own tribal governments, our own tribal health departments, if we so choose (Deloria & Lytle 1984). It was during these times in the late 1970s that the American Indian Movement was founded and Indian activists initiated takeovers of Alcatraz Island and of Wounded Knee.  It was out of the Indian Self-Determination Act that Tribal Colleges and Tribal Health Departments were born. 

<p>
The government responded to the Indian Self-Determination Act by allowing tribes the opportunity to administer programs that were run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.  This law provided a wonderful opportunity for Indians to manage their own affairs.  But the problem tribes faced was the lack of educated Indian people to carry out the managerial work of these programs.  The elected tribal councils lacked education and experience, as did the people they hired (McDonald 1998).

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
The Tribal College Movement
</font>

<p>
So to become educated Indian people began enrolling in colleges and universities and by 1976 the number of American Indians in colleges had risen to 76,000 but the completion rate was very poor.  The Congressional General Accounting Office audited ten colleges and universities trying to find out why Indian students were doing so poorly (Eschwage 1977).  They found that over one half of the first year students never completed the their education.

<p>
It was out of this predicament that tribal colleges were born.  A tribal college is a college declared by its tribe, governed by a tribally appointed board, and serves Indian students.  Tribal colleges are the most successful access for reaching college aged people on the reservation since pre contact with Europeans today, in the US there are 29 tribal colleges.

<p>
Prior to the establishment of Salish Kootenai College, the drop out rate for members of the Salish and Kootenai tribal members in post secondary education was well over fifty percent (Eschwage 1977). There are several theories why the dropout rate was so high.  One popular theory is that Indians are lazy and cannot get out of bed to go to school.  Another theory is that Indians see no value in completing school and that there is little hope for them to have any kind of a quality life.  Another theory focuses on positive role models for children who they follow the life styles of the adults around them, adults who may be unemployed, chronic welfare recipient, alcoholic, and unskilled.  There is a theory that the cycle of poverty, welfare, and despair is hard to break (McDonald 1998).

<p>
Our college President theorizes that Indians drop out of school because they were not encouraged to stay in school, encouraged by friendly teachers and classmates, encouraged by a vibrant and exciting educational program, encouraged by feeling successful, encouraged by having parents and the Indian community be proud of the school they are attending, and most importantly, encouraged by being recognized as an Indian person, a group of people that are an important and positive part of American history and American culture.

<p>
Burke's research (Burke, 1996) found the main reason Indian students dropped out of mainstream college was because in order to succeed, they had to give up thinking of themselves as Indian.

<p>
So often schools in America treat Indians as if they only live in the past.  In current events Indians do not exits. National polls relate that this percent of whites voted for President Clinton as did so many Blacks, so many Hispanics, so many Asians and so many others. The Indigenous people of the United States, the people that have always been the United States, the "First Americans" are referred to in polls as a part of "other"

<p>
Did you know that American Indians only became US citizens in 1929?  Our grandfathers were warriors in World War One without even being citizens.    

<p>
Indian people in America and Indigenous people throughout the world need more than just "mainstream" survival skills if we are going to function successfully in our respective societies. We need more than just survival skills if we are going see improved health.  Our Indigenous people need to have their skills and ambitions realized, and they need to move on to be full participants in our high tech work force, and in our professional fields such as medicine, research, law and engineering (McDonald 1998).

<p>
Each course of study at Salish Kootenai College is enriched with teaching and activities that enhance the students' Indian identity.  We want them to be proud of their Indian heritage and know why they should be proud.  We also want each degree program to provide quality education, and for each graduate to be very competent in applying their education to their job and their everyday life.

<p>
There are no entrance exam requirements at our college.  A student can receive financial aid assistance from the tribe or the federal government if he or she is eighteen years of age and has graduated from high school, or has obtained a secondary school general equivalency diploma.   

<p>
On admission, the student is given a placement test, which determines where they should start in reading, in English composition, and in mathematics.  A student may need to start in developmental courses with plans to take the General Equivalency Diploma examination.  But there are still college courses that students can take successfully, for example, Indian culture classes, Building Self Esteem, College Survival and Study Skills.  The students see themselves as a College Student even at this level.  The student is eligible to receive financial aid.  There is an increase in self-esteem and students learn about their culture as well as developing basic math and reading skills. 

<p>
Remember in the beginning I said we all need care.  Our students are treated with respect and with care; they are nurtured.  Our faculty and staff have a personal interest in each student's welfare.  The students respond positively to this environment.  They are no longer failures.  They are successful in their college careers.

<p>
Completion of a college certificate or degree certifies the student for entry into a particular job or qualifies the student to take a licensing examination such as a nurse, a dental assistant, or a medical record technician.   

<p>
When parents become successful in college, the entire family demonstrates more interest in formal schooling.  Their life styles become healthier.  There is less alcohol and drug abuse.  The children have healthy role models and are more interested in their own school. They complete a secondary school program and enter as SKC as freshmen.

<p>
As a result of the tribal college education, the tribe I work for, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribe of the Flathead Indian Reservation, is more competent in every facet as a tribe.  It is stronger in cultural participation.  There are more young people pursuing cultural activities such as drumming and singing, Indian dance, crafting traditional dancing outfits.  There are more ceremonial leaders, and prayer leaders.  The educational and skill level of the tribal work force has improved tremendously.  We now have Indian health professionals, nurses, human service professionals, lawyers, physicians and Indian technicians in almost every part of our tribal operation.

<p>
From my standpoint and from the standpoint of all of us who work at the College, feel rewarded tremendously when we see previously oppressed Indian people in a seemingly hopeless struggle for survival, have an internal awakening, and realize they can learn and improve their lives.  Life is not hopeless for them.  We have many success stories of Indian people discovering their human potential, of setting and attaining goals, and improving their own health and the health of their family.

<p>
The United States of America has gained a great deal by the creation of tribal colleges throughout Indian country.  A formerly dependent group of people is now becoming independent and capable of taking care of themselves.  All governments should do this for their Indigenous peoples. 

<p>
Tribal members are also more concerned about their personal health.  There are more people striving for healthy life styles.  We have fitness centers throughout the reservation.  We have fewer tribal members abusing alcohol and drugs.

<p>
I truly believe the tribal college model can work with any Indigenous people.  There is a college in northern Norway for the Sami (Keskitalo and Mohatt, 1994), and the Maoris in Aotearoa (New Zealand) are beginning to develop their own college system.  A college in Barrow, Alaska is being established for the Inupiat people (Ilisagvik).  Several countries have colleges for their Indigenous people, but the people who are served do not have control of the curriculum or of the administration.  In order to be truly successful the people being served must have control through the effort and support of the government.

<p>
Last June, Salish Kootenai College graduated 187 students with degrees in nursing, human services, environmental science, and dental assisting, medical records as well as degrees in office education, and vocational skills. The success tribal colleges have at graduating health care professionals and the increased level of education for Indian men and women have all contributed to improved health care for American Indian people.

<p>
Where once infant mortality was 22 percent in the 1970s, today it is 8.2 percent.  Where once the life expectancy was 45 years old, in most cases it is 75 years for women; on a level with non-Indian people.

<p>
Although the cancer incidence for American Indians is lower than for non Indians, the death rate is higher because we seek treatment later in the course of the disease; women especially are afraid to seek help, to have white physicians see their bodies.

<p>
Our Indian health care professionals are teaching our women with newly developed culturally appropriate videos and pamphlets about cancer, smoking, pregnancy problems, and baby bottle tooth decay. Many of the teaching materials are in the language of the people.

<p>
Collin Airhihenbuwa (1998), Head of the Department of Public Health at Pennsylvania State University once said: 

<p>
<blockquote>
"To invoke the centrality of culture in public health and health promotion is to challenge health promotion and disease prevention approaches that downplay or overlook the importance of history, politics, and education in shaping the landscape of cultural production.....The accomplishments of these tasks requires the deconstruction of existing systems of dominant values in a manner that challenges the very foundation of the social and cultural order.  Such a challenge is not merely to destroy a few prejudices; rather, it is to see through the revolving door of all rationalizations by meeting head-on the truth of the struggle between fiction and reality."  
</blockquote>

<p>
Tribal colleges contribute to that effort every year.

<p>
My friend and elder Ron Therriault, whose family also comes from eastern Canada, in Acadia, near my own family's roots, has told me, "We cannot be responsible for the actions of our ancestors.  We can only be responsible for our own actions."

<p>
It is not about what my grandfather did to your grandfather or if my grandmother did something to your grandmother.   It is not about Indigenous people as niggers, beasts, or pagan savages or the dominance of European white men.  It is about what we can do together today as human beings living on the planet.  It is about honoring Indigenous knowledge.  It is about how we live our lives in harmony with the Mother we call Earth.  It is about education and respect, not money or economic development.

<p>
<blockquote>
Our Indian heroes teach us the ways of courage.  They look straight into the eyes of what others fear, and speak out with their best voice.  They listen intently to those whose voice is sometimes unsure. Our greatest heroes, with fearless eyes and caring heart show us that there is power within us all (Dana Tiger /Creek).
</blockquote>

<p>
It is time our wisdom and culture was respected. It is timed to work collaboratively on issues affecting education of Indigenous peoples, the health of the planet and the health of all people. It is high time to mend the fences that divide us. We must walk the talk.  And we must walk that talk together!  It is time for heroes!
