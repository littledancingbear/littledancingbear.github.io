"We chiefs are the keepers of the Central Fire. But it's not just a fire of logs and flames. It is the fire in here (he pointed to his own heart with a gnarly finger) and also the fire in here (he tapped his forehead). A good heart and a good mind - those are what you need to be a chief." (Onondaga Chief Louis Farmer)

<p>
In 1492 a lost Italian Sailor, funded by Queen Isabella of Spain, sailed to the shores of what is now known as North America.  The meeting with Indigenous People there changed their lives forever.  As we have seen in the last lecture, Columbus attempted to recreate Spain on an island with a fragile rain forest ecosystem.  Where the largest animal was no bigger than a dog, Columbus brought cattle and horses.  The cattle and horses trammeled the rainforest. When the plants were destroyed, Columbus and his army replanted the island with crops near and dear to the health and palates of the Spaniards.  It was the first time Indigenous peoples of the Americas experienced a collision of culture. It would not be the last.  In the past 500 years, the impact of the European culture on the lifeways for the Indigenous people of the Americas has been devastating resulting in diseases, dietary change, population decline, destruction of culture, language, ceremonies, and changes in habitat.

<p>
For the next hour or so, let us focus on the decline of health, land and culture for the Indigenous people of the world.  As we have seen the health of Indigenous peoples is ultimately tied to the land, to their culture, but the invaders from European countries desired land for farming and ranching. The Spaniards came seeking gold, the French came to trade for furs, and the English sought to "civilize the savages" by bringing them from a hunter-gatherer-farming culture into the powdered silken civilization of George III.  In Australia, Europeans desired land for the incarceration of their convicted killers, rapists, killers, and other riffraff, whom they brought to the shores of Tasmania and Australia.

Sacred Soil of Our Grandmothers: A Brief Overview of European Contact
</font>

<p>	
We walked a long way that day along the river.  When it was evening we stopped in the shadow of the mountains.  The clouds glowed pink from the radiant sunset.  We set our feet in the water.  It was black, smooth and running fast.  Here and there in little pools dragonflies hunted the first mosquitoes of the evening.  Frogs harumphed.  The grasses were brown, parched from the hot summer sun. Along the trail, goldenrods were beginning to bloom signaling late summer and heralding autumn.  Across the river yellow wild iris, blooming late in the season, and forget-me-not gave color to the brown grass. Old grandmother Cyprus, ponderosa and lodge post pines lined the trail with dark shadows of greens.   I thought of the medicine in the plants, ancient healing secrets now lost to time because of cultural collisions (Colomeda 1999).

<p>
The collision of cultures between First Nations in North America and the invading Europeans caused societal and dietary changes among Indian people.   Those problems, which began in the 1400s, continue to exist and be problematic into this century, affecting the health, culture, and economies of First Nations communities.  In 1906, his grandchild asked Chitto Harjo, a Creek full-blood, to describe what he knew about the coming of the Europeans to his land.

<p>
<blockquote>
"Away back in that time in 1492_there was a man by the name of Columbus came from across the great ocean., and he discovered this country for the white man ...What did he find when he first arrived here?" (Debo 1970, p. 45).
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>Conquest of Paradise</i> by Kirkpatrick Sale is an exceptionally meaningful text in which Sale exposes the early effects of contact by Europeans on Indigenous People.  Sale's work is especially meaningful in reflection of the ecological destruction by Christopher Columbus on Hispanolia, and other parts of the Caribbean.

<p>
When Columbus returned to Spain with his exploration story, the rush was on.  Using the West Indies as a base, Spanish explorers set out in all compass directions. The first colony was established in 1494 on the Island of Hispanola (Espanola)  by Columbus during his second expedition (Debo1970).  To create a lifestyle in Hispanola as it had been in Spain, Columbus imported livestock, chickpeas, wheat, grapes and olives.  He acted without considering the fragility of the local ecosystem and without thought that these new life forms might not thrive.  Attempts to change the environment to suit the Castilian diet were never completely successful and Columbus decided to rely on imports from Spain (Sale 1991). 

<p>
It hardly mattered whether the new species were malign or malignant, the more they adapted themselves to their new environment, the more they displaced native species, the more they altered and eventually transformed the stable ecosystem of the islands (Sale 1991, 163).

<p>
Cattle and horses were let loose to roam all over an island where the largest mammal was the size of a dog.  Eventually, the herd numbered more than 8000 and a ranchero mentality system was installed with "cowboys" on horseback complete with Spanish lassos to round them up.   Europeans had produced a red-meat dependent culture in a tropical rain forest which ensured environmental destruction of the islands (Sale 1991).

<p>
To Queen Isabella his pathetic reports of the tropical rain forest demonstrated that Columbus was at a loss for words, "...green, very green, big lakes, big trees not like ours" was his description of the magnificent tropical forests with colorful, abundant species and calls of birds, unusual flowering plants, multi shades of greens, delightful mammals  (Sale 1991).  Instead, Columbus approached nature with a utilitarian ethics.  He was unable to describe the natural beauty of the Islands, but he was master at determining the usefulness and potential value of selling it in Spain.   He writes in his journal of 1492, October 19th:

<p>
<blockquote>
"Such handsome verdure and so different from our ours, and I believe in it there are many plants and many trees which are most valued in Spain for their dyes and for medicinal spices" (Sale 1991).
</blockquote>

<p>
Plants such as daisies, dandelions and nettles, brought by the Spanish grew in such prolific numbers in the lush rain forests that they crowded out Indigenous plants and invaded any open space.  In just two decades the agricultural practices of the Spanish led to deforestation of the Islands.  Rivers silted up and the total climate of the area was altered (Sale 1991). 	

<p>
In just two decades the islands were laid waste, inhabited only by wild animals and birds and useless for the service of God ... It was the first to be made into a desert, but not the last (1518 correspondence by Alonso de Zuaso to a friend in the Spanish Court , Sale 1991, 165).

<p>
The English and Jamestown Colony in Virginia heralded the second invasion of Europeans in the Americas.  Much like the Spanish, the British sought to impose their culture, exploit the land and subjugate the people.  John Smith is quoted as Jamestown being "A verie fit place for erecting a citie."   For the first twenty years, hundreds of people died of starvation-related illnesses because the English did not know how to feed themselves in their new environment.  In true Columbian (Christopher) tradition, the Jamestown colonists refused to adopt the ways of the Native people, refused to learn "foreign" farming techniques and became idle, lazy "gentlemen" (Sale 1991).  It all came down to the fact that the Spanish and the English considered the natives of the Americas as less than human.  Contemporary 17th Century thought involved such ideas as:  "I cannot call them men; in order to Christianize them, they must be made into men."   The historian Gary Nash notes that to call the Native "beasts" or "brutes" prepared the future for Native people as beings to be domesticated or controlled, or confined to parks and reservations (Sale 1991).

<p>	
In Circumpolar Peoples such as the Inuit, Inupiat, Sami, Lapps, Yakut, Aleuts and Chukchi there is a profound respect for the fruits of the earth and the oceans.  The sea is seen as sacred and life giving (Shephard & Rode 1996). Such a world view is in direct contrast to white doctrine which promotes subjugation of the environment rather than cooperation with it.  Historians feel that European contact with Circumpolar people in North America began in when Viking explorers sailed north from Greenland and encountered Dorset settlements.  More than 1000 years later, British Whalers plying the waters off the coast of Baffin Island, Pond Inlet and Cumberland Sound received gifts of Viking chain armor from Inuit people in return for needles, awls, and knives.  By 1832, after a few years of commerce with the Inuit, whole villages had died of smallpox or diphtheria and left the population of Bowhead whales glutted.   Today, two hundred Bowhead (Greenland Right) Whales are all that remain of that prodigious eastern Arctic population.  Missionaries, French fishermen and explorers soon followed the whalers.  All brought with them cultural philosophies and diseases from Europe that impacted the health and culture of Northern Indigenous People. A Yup'ik hunter on St. Lawrence Island once described white people as, "The people who change nature" (Lopez 1986, 39).  The Upper Skaget Tribe in Washington call the Europeans "The changers" (Conversation with Vi Hilbert, 1997) 

<p>
The Europeans never really understood the culture they were trying to subjugate.  What eluded the Europeans, and continues to elude, was the intimate abiding interconnectedness the Native people had with nature.  Labeling it a religion of animism (from the Latin anima-soul) which sees life in all natural things, they failed to see the complexities of the relationship between Native people and the spirits of all natural things such as mountains, lakes, rivers, trees, animals.  For Native people, the spirits inhabiting nature is the very center of existence, a great unifying Life Force.  Kinship with all creatures is very real. 

<p>
<blockquote>
"The Earth is our nurturing Mother and we are equal not superior to the Web of Life that connects us all.  We are totally dependent on the natural world for our survival" (Luther Standing Bear, Lakota).  
</blockquote>

<p>
Healthy Indian societies made their earth-relationship further apparent in how they lived on the land.  Different environments fostered different approaches, but what is striking is the recurrent evidence that as hunters or fishers or planters or pickers, Native people were ritualistically conscious and concerned about the effect of their actions on their surroundings and careful to see that those limits and constraints were observed (Sale 1991).  Identification with a specific territory was rooted in the spirits of the ancestors who were buried within the soils.  The land is the culture.

<p>
We can examine the two basic contemporary approaches to nature and the environment by comparing the differences in environmental ethics between the European view and First Nations world view, the anthropocentric and the non anthropocentric.  Anthropocentric ethicists would argue that nature has value for human beings.  It must be respected as a means to human ends  (Chessworth 1996).  It is a vision in which technology will solve all the problems.  It is the vision that humans are masters over the earth.

<p>
The non anthropocentric ethic embraces many variations from animal liberation, ecofeminism, and deep ecology.  Human beings have a moral obligation to recognize that they are only part of the larger reality and they need to sacrifice individual interests on occasion to those of the whole (Chessworth 1996).  

<p>
During the Dark Ages in Europe, the Christian Church was a powerful entity and  inquiry into the workings of the natural world was not encouraged. It was enough to know that God had created them.  Forests were dark, evil places.  Mountains fared no better.  And what lived in all of these dark, scary places was the Wild Hairy Man with exposed genitals who would carry off young maidens into the wilderness (Sale 1991).  Wilderness was a place to be feared.   European ecological heritage is born from such fear, dominance over nature, and hostility toward things unknown.  Today, evidence of such ecological disaster in Europe is found in the form of deforestation, erosion, siltation, pollution, and extermination of species; all done in the name of providing for the betterment of society; all accomplished in ignorance of the natural systems and the human connection to them (Sale 1991). Is it any wonder then, that the Europeans called the Native people savages and beasts inhabiting a wilderness to be tamed? 

<p>
<blockquote>	
"Europeans came to the Americas with their beliefs that not only the women and children to be owned, but ... that the church and the education system were best for "savages."  They removed the Indigenous children from their native communities and placed them in residential schools.  These children were then "parented" by nuns, priests, and often single female teachers who were inexperienced in child rearing" (Hill 1995).
</blockquote>

<p>
During the American Revolution, both the British and the Americans labored to win over the Indians as active participants in the war between England and the Europeans, the new Americans, who inhabited the colonies.  When England signed the second Treaty of Paris in 1783 [ended the Revolutionary War and gave the newly independent United States jurisdiction over American lands formerly held by Britain.  One of the most pressing tasks the new government faced was development of a policy toward Indians who inhabited that territory] their philosophies regarding the land and Native people as things to be tamed were carried forward by the new Americans "for the good of society."  To the diplomats in Paris, the Indians went along with the land.  When the new United States began to establish peaceful relations with the Indian people, the hidden agenda was that of acquiring Indian Lands (Debo 1970).

<p>
With European contact came a new set of beliefs and world view.  These beliefs conflicted with the Indigenous belief. Natives struggled to retain both a cultural identity and a system of beliefs unique to themselves.  The once open, honest teachings were forced underground along with their medicines, songs, and ceremonies (Hill 1995). 

<p>
As the anthropocentric/Christian view dominated the westward expansion of European Americans it resulted in environmental destruction for the ecosystems of North America and the First Nations who depended on these ecosystems for survival.

<p>
Missionaries and government agents applied pressure on the American Indians to change their culture soon after they were restricted to reservations.  Among other changes, it was now impossible for the Plateau [Plains] people to depend on fishing and hunting, which had previously supported them well.  Sufficient land was no longer accessible for these activities (Ackerman 1987).

<p>
By the Mid 1800s, in the Plains cultures, the bison were decimated, the prairie grasses were overrun with monocultures, Christian boarding schools erected, languages and cultural ceremonies were lost, and much of what was known about a healthy Indian Lifestyle was a victim of progress of individual interests. 

<p>	
Parents lost hope when their children left for the boarding schools.  They turned to alcohol to lessen the pain of loneliness and sense of failure.  Children returned for holidays and summer breaks found their parents either intoxicated or gone (Hill 1995).

<p>
The experiences in the boarding schools of today's grandparents continue to impact Native traditions and cultures in the form of low self-esteem, suicide, substance abuse, spousal abuse, and child abuse. Because of the abuses suffered in boarding school, sexual as well as mental and physical, and the lack of nurturing from the natural mother, both men and women lost respect for the women and the role of women in the community.  All of these ... effects are the result of oppression, church domination, and the patrilineal government (Hill 1995).

<p>
Many Native people believe that such social/environmental health problems were not seen in First Nations communities until European contact destroyed the healthy ecosystems and tribal cultures which people depended on (Hill 1995). 

<p>
As we have read in <i>Keepers of the Central Fire</i>, when Indigenous people are brought into collisions of culture with dominant societies, they suffer from cultural and spiritual losses.  The problems that emanate from such losses contribute to health effects which are exhibited in poor self esteem, alcohol and spousal abuse, huffing gasoline, suicide, heart disease, cancers from exposure to chemicals and toxins, as well as a host of other insidious health problems.

United States Government Indian Removal Policies as contributing to poor health
</font>

<p>
To make room for cattle, sheep, and white farmers, it was the policy of the US Government to remove Indian people from their traditional homelands, to herd them away from their traditional and cultural plants, from the ashes of grandfathers.  Like wolves and other "undesirables", East of the Mississippi River, many eastern woodland tribes were removed to what the US government called, "Indian Territory" Oklahoma.   

<p>
Andrew Jackson was elected president in 1828 ... it was clear that he would remove the Indians West by force (Debo 1970).  Even before his inauguration, the states of Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama passed laws, which extended their jurisdiction over the Indian people, making it illegal for an Indian to testify in court over a white man.

<p>
The Removal Act of 1830, signed by President Andrew Jackson argued that "no state could achieve proper culture, civilization, and progress, as long as Indians remained within its boundaries". Jackson ordered that the Five Civilized Tribes, the Cherokees, Creek, Choctaws, Chickasaws and Seminoles must move from the southern states to the Indian Territory, now known as Oklahoma - a word that means "red people". It was solemnly sworn in a "permanent treaty" to be the Indian's Promised Land "for as long as grass grows and water flows" - which turned out to mean until the white man wanted more land.

Check out this internet site to understand how the Seminole Indian tribe of Florida reacted to the removal policies.

<p>
The Cherokees, about 16,000 in number, put up the greatest resistance and were the last to be evicted. They had adopted the ways of the White people, living in pillared houses, and practicing farming and Christianity.  They were not nomads, as were many other tribes. They loved their native hills and valleys, streams and forests, fields, plantations, and herds of domestic animals. They enjoyed established houses and communities, and had learned to "talk on paper" like the white man. Many had accepted the white man's God, and they had translated the Bible into Cherokee language. The Cherokees had adopted a constitution asserting that they were a sovereign and free nation, and consequently were recognized by world powers. 

<p>
A treaty with the United States preserved rights to their homeland in parts of Tennessee and Georgia, but when gold was discovered in Georgia, the state's proclamation that "all laws, orders, and regulations of any kind made with the Cherokee Indians are declared null and void" resulted in a horrendous land-grab and then in a death march which is one of the saddest and most disturbing events in America's so called manifest destiny. "One fourth of the Cherokees perished as they were first herded into stockades and then "set toward the setting sun" in cold, hunger, illness, and in complete desolation (Debo 1970).

<p>
<blockquote>
"The military collected the People [The Creeks] and brought them into a crudely built stockade.  There was an awful silence that showed the heartaches and sorrow at being taken from their homes and separation from their loved ones…But times became more horrible after the real journey was begun.  Many fell by the wayside, too faint with hunger or too weak to keep up with the rest….A crude bed was quickly prepared for these sick and weary people and only a bowl of water was left within reach and they were made to suffer and die alone" (Debo 1970, 120)

<p>
The importance of treaties to Native people cannot be underestimated.  The Federal and Provincial Governments had a duty, not just a fiduciary duty, but legal, in bringing about the valid implementation of treaty rights.

<p>
In the following two examples we will see that Indian Removal was not just confined to the United States, the Canadian government is also guilty of removing Indian people from their homelands.

<p>
The Mi'kmaq people, The People of the Dawn, also called the People of the Eastern Gate, were the first of the Canadian Tribes to enter into trading relationships with the Europeans. The tribe's territory extended throughout what is now Maritime Canada.

<p>
I am a descendent of French-Canadians Mi'kmaq People.  We learned their religion, the jigs, and reels, and we prayed to Ste. Anne.  We were the first people to live in two worlds.  During the War with England, The American Revolution, French and Mi'kmaq were close allies with many French taking Mi'kmaq women for their wives. 

<p>
In the mid 1800s, the game of hockey developed as a result of this fusion of cultures.  The Mi'kmaq brought the puck and the stick to the game.  When the stick was first manufactured commercially by Starr Manufacturing, it was called the Micmac stick.  The Mi'kmaq strapped shin blade bones onto their moccasins as skates on ice.

</li>
</ul>

<p> 
The Mi'kmaq people have always known about medicine and secret, curative powers of plants from Mother Earth.  Many Mi'kmaq shared their knowledge of plants with the French and the Europeans and in many cases helped to save their lives when they became ill.  Their knowledge of roots and medicines makes up the basis of many of the prescription drugs available today.  This is a major contribution of the Mi'kmaq to all societies.

<p>
The earliest recorded song in North America was Mi'kmaq, recorded by a Jesuit Priest, Father Lescarbot in 1606 sung in the meadows near Membertou's (a powerful holy man in Mi'kmaq culture) camp.  It was not documented, however, whether the song was a healing song. 

<p>
In spite of all of these contributions to health and well-being, the Europeans in Canada battered and purged the Mi'kmaq people.  By 1850 there were only 2,000 Mi'kmaq people alive and their health was poor because of cultural contact with the Europeans (Paul 1993).  

<p>
"There can be no doubting an Indian Superintendent's 1861 assessment of all the Indians in Nova Scotia as destitute and miserable, starving and crying for food, they were ready to drop from hunger"  (Paul 1993, 187).

<p>
"Whooping cough, measles, typhus, typhoid, and smallpox all are recorded as causes of death among the Micmac in the early part of the nineteenth century" (Paul 1993, 188).

<p>
A great number and variety of diseases were prevalent among the Micmac people particularly after 1800 when they were forced to come into contact with white settlements to beg for food as their land base shrank in the face of ever increasing expansion by the whites (Paul 1993).

<p>
In Northern Quebec, Hydro Quebec stole lands from the Cree in the 1970s to build dams across the rivers used for traditional fishing and lands used for hunting were flooded.  To control the dams, non-Indians were brought in and the people were brought to settlement.  The men no longer hunted.  The white people the culture and self-esteem dropped. Spousal abuse, alcoholism, huffing, and suicides, all previously unknown to the Cree, increased.

<p>
In the past, Indigenous peoples had no experience with health problems currently developing in our environment. We never took more than we needed, and always gave back to Mother when we took from her. A massive paradigm shift, from the Indigenous concept of land caring in which we learned to work with nature in a positive way to the concept in vogue today of the European idea of "sustainable development". For Indigenous Peoples, this is a conflict in cultural values, or a collision of cultures. Collisions of cultures are affecting all Indigenous cultures from those who do not respect the earth. Cultures are under siege from conflicts over treaty rights, water rights, and extraction resources, such as gold and uranium mining, and even tribal sovereignty. 

<p>
These collisions of cultures have been the root of physical and mental health problems in our youth; problems which are exhibited in poor self-esteem, drug abuse, incarceration, and even suicides. Among our women, the PCBs from industrial waste create toxic waste dumps of our breasts; we experience lung cancer, and our children are born with congenital anomalies from the effects of uranium mining.

Healthy Indian People

<p>
Since 1955, the U.S. Public Health Service, through its Indian Health Service (IHS) component, has had the responsibility of providing comprehensive health services to American Indians and Alaska Native people in order to elevate their health status to the highest possible level.   The mission of the IHS is to provide a comprehensive health services delivery system for America Indians and Alaska Natives with the opportunity for maximum tribal involvement in developing and managing programs to meet their needs (Trujillo1995, i)

<p>	
Healthy People 2000 Objectives is 700 pages of health data collected, compiled, and developed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services on all Americans.  It demonstrates areas of health success and health deficits for the American People.   Although targeting American Indians and Alaska Natives as a special populations minority in its assessment of health among American people, Healthy People 2000 Objectives does not notably examine environmental health problems for any group of Americans or those chiefly related to reservations and reserves across North America.  These include health effects resulting from ecological pollution and collisions of culture such as emissions of toxic waste dumps, mining, and air pollution.   In addressing health problems which arise from collisions of cultures, loss of identity and economics, Young's study (1996) presents further in-depth, detailed, statistics addressing these issues through the process of bio-cultural epidemiology. 

<p>
"Diabetes, alcohol abuse, suicide, and spousal abuse are the  direct result of culture loss and that includes loss of tribal lands"  (Conversation with  Ron Therriault, 1996, member of the Salish Tribe, Montana).  Young (1994) indicates that acts of violence are intimately related to the mental health of individuals and the social health of the community.  

<p>
Healthy People 2000 Objectives record leading causes of death for American Indians as heart disease and cancer, although injuries involving motor vehicle accidents and alcohol account for 1/5 the number of deaths affecting American Indian people.  Alcohol is also a known factor in suicide and homicide rates for the American Indian people.  Alcohol abuse, diabetes, and obesity are other risk factors that stand out as problems for American Indians (US Dept. of Health and Human Services), but are not addressed as environmental health issues.

<p>
<blockquote>
"Suicide and homicide are extreme (and lethal) outcomes of violent behavior, whether inflicted on oneself or directed at others.  The excessive mortality and morbidity associated with these conditions among Native Americans, in comparison to non-Native populations in North America, are almost universal across tribes and regions" (Young 1994, 189).
</blockquote>

<p>
Just as there are cultural differences among tribes, researchers emphasize the diversity and cultural specificity of suicide rates (Shore 1975).   For example, in Alaska during the oil boom of the 1960s and 1970s the suicide rate increased dramatically among the Inupiat of the North Slope and among the Athabascan Indians of the interior. These groups were more affected culturally and socially by the oil boom. In Canada, Garro (1988) found that the more isolated and more northerly the tribe, the lower the suicide rate.   However, this was the reverse for Alberta and Manitoba tribes where the suicide rates for northern reserves was 2.3 times higher in Alberta  (Bagley et al. 1990) and 2.6 times higher in Manitoba (Garro 1988) than for the southern reserves.  Suicide rate was also correlated with distance from an urban center as well as per capita income (Bagley et al. 1990).

Billson (1994) indicates that substance abuse, spousal abuse, and child abuse were not present in Inuit Arctic communities until Inuit were brought by the government into settlements.  In settlement, a male-female role reversal ensued.  Women worked outside the home for the cash economy and men no longer hunted, but tended the home and the children.

For American Indians, other disease such as infectious disease have been problematic throughout  the period of contact whereas today, immunizations have reduced the epidemiological significance of measles, rubella, mumps, poliomyelitis, tetanus, and diphtheria in Native communities (Young 1994).   For infectious diseases generally, Native people are at higher risk than non-natives reflecting the distribution and frequency of specific infections reflect the local ecological, socioeconomic, and cultural factors (Young 1994).  "The building of the Alaska Highway during World War II by the U.S. Military resulted in a series of epidemics among Natives in the Yukon" (Young 1994).  On other reserves examples of infectious disease epidemics include: Poliomyelitis epidemic in Chesterfield Inlet, Northwest Territories contracted from white workers stationed in Churchill, Manitoba.  Two percent of the population died.  (Adamson et al.1949).  In 1952, a measles epidemic swept through the Ungava peninsula of Northern Quebec which infected 99% of the population.  Two to nine percent of the population died.  This epidemic was traced to Goose Bay Labrador.  (Peart et al. 1954).

Erin's Words: The Month of the Huckleberries 

<p> 
I grew up on the Fort Belknap Reservation.  I am an enrolled tribal member.  I come from the tribe called the Gros Ventre.  The other tribe [on the reservation] is called the Assiniboine. On my reservation, or just a few miles off the reservation but on the boundary of the reservation we have a mining industry called Pegasus Gold Corporation and another called the Landusky Mining.  Cyanide heap leach mining is how it affects our land, animals, and community.  The mining is degrading the environment close to my reservation.  The tailings from the mine are going into our fresh water streams and our fresh water.  This happens when the spring thaw comes, when all the snow comes off the mountains.  The tailings get there by the blasting that goes on day and night.  I have seen how the water looks from this pollution.  It has a ugly yellowish brown look to it and it isn't very pleasant to look at.  Comparing some of the water that looks contaminated to the streams that haven't been damaged by the pollution, you can tell there is something wrong with this whole mining thing.  This mining first started when I was 3 years old in 1979.  I have seen what the mountains looked like before they started mining and they're really beautiful.  I can remember one time I went hiking in this area called the South Fork to go look at some beavers and beaver dams that were up in the canyon.  when I got to the place where the beaver's homes were supposed to be, I wasn't amused with what I saw.  I seen a dead beaver and there was nothing alive near those beaver dams.  It had a ugly look to it, like something just came through and took its pride away from it.  So I figure when the spring thaw came off the mountains, it brought death from the mines.  I know everything used to look beautiful up there on that side of the reservation line before the mining.  I am afraid sooner or later our side of the mountains is going to end up looking like that if we don't start doing something about it now instead of waiting till it's too late.

<p>
I have learned that the people are so greedy that they don't take people or animals into consideration.  They just keep on working and polluting.  They don't stop to think about migrating birds die from drinking contaminated pools that they put their tailings in.  Animals don't know if the water is good or bad. 'Cause to them, everything is good and nothin' used to be polluted.  I will tell you a little about these pools they use.  These pools are supposed to be lined with a special liner that is supposed to prevent seepage.  These pools [liners] have a tendency to tear and rip and the workers seem not to even care.

<p>
There are abandon mine pits which slowly refill with water to become massive pit lakes and rocks unexposed to air can leach into the water forming a toxic brew. There's another thing that is hurting the land by mining industries. It's called "dewatering".  That is when the mining companies pump water not only from the mining pits that run deeper than the water table, but from surrounding areas creating enormous tracts of arid land. People really can't do anything to prevent this because they [ the mining company] just ignore you like never even talked to them or try to explain the problem.

<p>
On our reservation a doctor from some city came to do some tests on the children for lead.  After the tests were taken, he discovered that out of 70 children, 20 had high counts of lead in their blood.  When they tried to tel the environmental health workers off the reservation, they said the blood was probably tampered with before it reached the lab.  So again, they put this important issues aside.  Another thing, on our reservation a lot of the men and women have gotten cancer.  A lot of women got breast cancer and the men got prostate cancer.  When you try to tell somebody about this, somebody that you think might help, it turns out that they ain't going to give you the time of day.

<p>
My grandmother had breast cancer and it hurts me to think that it could have been caused by the mines in the canyon.  My grandmother lives next to the mouth of the canyon that leads to the mine.  The way things are going on now, it seems like there's never going to be a day when it will end.

<p>
We have a lot of sacred things in the canyon, sacred things that deserve a lot of respect.  Respect was all we wanted when we asked them to quit mining for a few days while the Sun Dance in the canyon was going on.  But they just ignored the request and went on blasting during the ceremony and with their loud machinery.  During the Pow Wow you can always hear the workers that work nights and the workers that work days come off the mountains and pass through the Pow Wow grounds.  So actually we people who are here never really get peace from all this.

<p>
I figure the reservation was given to us and not the mining industry.  I think sooner or later that the government is going to try and take our side of the mountains to make their greedy little hearts happy and to fill up their pockets with the gold that they find.  It hurts me to see the elders of our reservation have to worry themselves about this when all they should be worrying about is their health.  They probably want the memory of a beautiful mountain range.  Instead they are going to get the ugly run downed mountains, if we don't do something now about the mountains.  Sometimes, I am told that I live here because of how beautiful it is.  Fort Belknap is my home and I should try to make a difference in the environment here.   I can't do very much now except to learn about the mining and I hope later that in my life all this [knowledge] will pay off in the long run.  I think later on there is going to be some political war or an environmental issue war if somebody doesn't make some kind of progress.  I hope it don't come to that cause that would put the people of Fort Belknap in a predicament  they won't want to be in.  We might even end up losing everything we have now, even though [what we have] is just a little.  We still love our piece of land even though it ain't much.  Maybe later on down the line, the people who are mining will realize they are destroying lives and the environment.  But it ain't the mining workers that are going to make change.  It's going to be the proud American Indians of Fort Belknap.

Grandmother Little Shell speaks about the gold mine:

<p>
"Too young to be a grandmother," she tells me, but her daughter honored her as a grandmother by giving birth quite young.  Today, she is a revered tribal member.  One of the few who graduated from college. Her mother and several of her relatives are suffering from cancer.  Grandmother Little Shell looks out at me from behind the frames of her glasses.  Her black eyes glint with anger as she speaks the words.  

<p>
<blockquote>
Grandmother Little Shell's Words: The Story Telling Month

Not only has the mine cause a great deal of surface destruction in the form of denuding the mountains of rocks, soils, trees, it has contaminated everything around us.  Pegasus Gold Mining Company has created cyanide leach fields which for years have been leaking and contaminating the water. There are no native fish living in the streams. The game animals that people depend on for food, are contaminated with tumors. No one would eat them.   Although some of the tribal members work for Pegasus, many feel that Pegasus is guilty of environmental racism.  It has destroyed a way of life for the people of the Fort Belknap reservation. 

What the mining company does is pile up a huge heap of soil, rocks and material taken as they tear down the mountains.  This material is piled together in huge areas the size of several football fields.  Cyanide is sprayed on the soil and water is sprayed to saturate the soils, as the liquid seeps out, the gold leaches out.  The water and the cyanide trickle down into the sub soils and runs off into holding ponds.  When the linings in the holding ponds leaks, the cyanide leaks out and contaminates the water supply, streams,  everything in its path.

We went up the canyon, out to the creeks one summer to look for beavers, but they were all dead from the mining.

Treaty Rights and Health Care
</font>

<p>
(From Dr. Carol Minghu's lecture on Treaty Rights from The Evergreen State University, Washington)

<p>
<blockquote>
The early treaties (1779-1810) were made to provide peace for the early settlers.  The settlers were weak economically and militarily and needed the alliances against the British, French and Spanish.  Indians negotiated treaties from a position of strength during this time. The period 1817- 1846 brought about the "treaties of removal."  These treaties were brought about because of the decimation of the Indian populations and the resulting loss of power.  The removal of the Cherokees (the Trail of Tears) and other Great Lakes and southeastern tribes to lands west of the Mississippi. And finally the "reservation treaties" 1846 -1864, which were referred to as the "treaties of peace and friendship."  As the West, Southwest, and Pacific Northwest Territories were claimed by the US, it became impossible to force Indians to move further west and war was too expensive.   These treaties were executed at great cost in lives of both the Indians and the US army. 

<p>
The Trust Relationship: Indian tribes are not foreign nations, but constitute distinct political communities "that may, more correctly, perhaps be denominated domestic, dependent nations whose relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.  This wording taken from Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) has been the root of the doctrine of federal trusteeship in Indian affairs.

<p>
The treaty period from the pre-constitution to 1871 when through congressional action the US. Government stopped ratifying treaties with the tribes, reveals a continual making of treaties and then deciding the land reserved should be reduced again.  The treaties were developed during three distinct periods during the expansion of the United States.

<p>
During the 17th century, the administrators of some British and Spanish Colonies in the Americas began negotiating treaties with Indian tribes.  These actions were rationalized by theological, philosophical, and practical arguments, had the effect of according tribes a sovereign status equivalent to that of the colonial governments which they were dealing.  

<p>
To the extent that treaties involved cessions of Indian Territory or resolved boundary disputes, they also affirmed recognition by the colonial powers of tribal ownership of the lands Indians used and occupied.  Such rights had been asserted a century earlier by Spanish theological jurists such as Francisco de Victoria and Bartolome de las Casas. 

<p>
Shortly before the middle of the 18th Century, the British Crown appropriated to itself some of the administrative responsibilities in dealing with tribes that it previously had allowed the colonial governments to exercise.  By this time, the practice of negotiating with the Indians through treaty had been well established. 

<p>
The Articles of Confederation, which became effective in 1781, were ambiguous concerning state and federal power over Indian affairs, "provided that the legislative right of any state within its wonloikts be not infringed or violated.

<p>
Reserved rights doctrine: Tribal rights, including rights to land and to self-government, are not granted to the tribe by the United States.  Rather under the reserved rights doctrine, tribes retained ("reserved") such rights as a part of their status as prior and continuing sovereigns.

<p>
Canons of construction: Courts generally have adopted fundamental rules and principles that govern the interpretation of written documents such as treaties.  In legal terminology, these rules and principles are known as "canons of construction."  Those that pertain specifically to Indian law generally have been developed to benefit the tribes.  For example, the canons provide that treaties are to be construed broadly in determining the existence of Indian rights, but narrowly when considering the elimination or abrogation of those rights.  Most of the special canons of construction dealing with treaty rights also have been applied to agreements, executive orders and statutes, dealing with Indians.

<p>
Congress' plenary power: Rights established by treaty, or by other documents, can be abrogated by congress pursuant to its plenary power.

Health Care, Education and Treaty Rights in Montana
</font>

<p>
In 1802, the sense of responsibility to the Indian people spilled over into medical care when the US War Department's Army officers began treating Indian people near the military posts for smallpox and other contagious disease to protect the soldiers from infection during battle.  In the 1830's a new series of treaties was implemented as the US government agreed to provide medical care in return for the rights and property it stole from the Indigenous people.

<p> 
Treaties of 1855: Hellgate, and others: In 1855 The Bitteroot Salish of Montana and the United States government entered into a treaty.  The Bitteroot Salish relinquished their lands in the Bitterroot Mountains, stretching into Canada, and to the eastern middle half of the State of Montana.  In return they were guaranteed 2.2 million Acres in the Mission and Jocko Valleys, health care, and education.  They were forced to share this land with the Kootenai people of northern Montana and of Canada.  Today the two tribes are known as the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.   Each tribe has its own cultural committee, pow wow, ceremonies, language and laws.  They share the tribal council in which each tribe has representatives. 

<p>
<a href="http://www.ldb.org/vl/ai/hellgate.htm">http://www.ldb.org/vl/ai/hellgate.htm</a>

<p>
During the 1850s other tribes were brought to the reservations in exchange for land, education and health.  The Blackfeet Tribe once roamed across all of Montana terrorizing and plundering.  They were the most feared warriors of all the Plains Tribes.  When they made the first treaty with the government, their reservation extended across the northern tier of Montana from Idaho to North Dakota.  Today the original Blackfeet reservation is broken up into Fort Peck, Fort Belknap, Rocky Boy and Blackfeet reservations.  Each time the government broke the original treaty to make room for settlers, cows and white expansion.

<p>
Health is a Treaty Right guaranteed by the Federal Government to the Indian people of The United States.

A few Words on Canadian Treaties with Aboriginal People  

<p>
The most significant of all Canadian treaties involving the Aboriginal community was the Indian Act of 1867.  As a result of the Indian Act all reserve lands were to be held in trust by the Crown for use of band members.  In Nova Scotia, band members did not and currently do not own the land they live on.  The act officially banned cultural events such as potlatches, ceremonial dances, voting in federal elections and enfranchised women who married non-Aborigines. The Act has since been overturned.

<p>
Traditional federal native policy in Canada was directed in two directions:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Assimilating Natives into non-native society
<li>
Isolating Native culture until eventual extinction
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Treaties in Canada were methods to impose non-Native legislation on a society where it was traditionally foreign.

The Indian Health Service as a Treaty Right
</font>

<p>
To solve the problems of Indian poor health, the federal government developed the Indian Health Service. IHS was a department of the US government set up under the War Department in the 1950s to provide Indian people with health access, to treat the disease that initially resulted from European contact.

<p>
Changes in diets and dependence on store bought foods resulted in an increase in sugars and carbohydrates in our diets leading to obesity and diabetes; we suffered from small pox, influenza, malnutrition. Indian Health Service in those early days was staffed by indifferent and often prejudiced non-Indians and was not very successful in providing health care for Indian people. Today Indian Health Service is placed under the US Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Public Health which has the responsibility for providing health care for all Indian people. Today many of the staff include native physicians, social workers, and nurses. Indian Health Services provides scholarships and training for Indian people who want to enter health care professions. How did we get to that point? From an infant mortality of 22 per 1000 births to what it is today?  

<p>
In 1965 The Indian Self Determination Act was passed by the US Congress to give Indian people freedom of religion, freedom to manage our own education, our own tribal governments, our own tribal health departments, if we so choose. It was during these times in the late 1970s that the American Indian Movement was founded and Indian activists initiated takeovers of Alcatraz Island and of Wounded Knee. It was out of the Indian Self-Determination Act that Tribal Colleges and Tribal Health Departments were born.

Indian Removal
</font>
<br>
Extract from Andrew Jackson's Seventh Annual Message to Congress, December 7, 1835

<p> 
The plan of removing the aboriginal people who yet remain within the settled portions of the United States to the country west of the Mississippi River approaches its consummation. It was adopted on the most mature consideration of the condition of this race, and ought to be persisted in till the object is accomplished, and prosecuted with as much vigor as a just regard to their circumstances will permit, and as fast as their consent can be obtained. All preceding experiments for the improvement of the Indians have failed. It seems now to be an established fact they can not live in contact with a civilized community and prosper. Ages of fruitless endeavors have at length brought us to a knowledge of this principle of intercommunication with them. The past we can not recall, but the future we can provide for. Independently of the treaty stipulations into which we have entered with the various tribes for the usufructuary rights they have ceded to us, no one can doubt the moral duty of the Government of the United States to protect and if possible to preserve and perpetuate the scattered remnants of this race which are left within our borders. In the discharge of this duty an extensive region in the West has been assigned for their permanent residence. It has been divided into districts and allotted among them. Many have already removed and others are preparing to go, and with the exception of two small bands living in Ohio and Indiana, not exceeding 1,500 persons, and of the Cherokees, all the tribes on the east side of the Mississippi, and extending from Lake Michigan to Florida, have entered into engagements which will lead to their transplantation.

<p>
The plan for their removal and reestablishment is founded upon the knowledge we have gained of their character and habits, and has been dictated by a spirit of enlarged liberality. A territory exceeding in extent that relinquished has been granted to each tribe. Of its climate, fertility, and capacity to support an Indian population the representations are highly favorable. To these districts the Indians are removed at the expense of the United States, and with certain supplies of clothing, arms, ammunition, and other indispensable articles; they are also furnished gratuitously with provisions for the period of a year after their arrival at their new homes. In that time, from the nature of the country and of the products raised by them, they can subsist themselves by agricultural labor, if they choose to resort to that mode of life; if they do not they are upon the skirts of the great prairies, where countless herds of buffalo roam, and a short time suffices to adapt their own habits to the changes which a change of the animals destined for their food may require. Ample arrangements have also been made for the support of schools; in some instances council houses and churches are to be erected, dwellings constructed for the chiefs, and mills for common use. Funds have been set apart for the maintenance of the poor; the most necessary mechanical arts have been introduced, and blacksmiths, gunsmiths, wheelwrights, millwrights, etc., are supported among them. Steel and iron, and sometimes salt, are purchased for them, and plows and other farming utensils, domestic animals, looms, spinning wheels, cards, etc., are presented to them. And besides these beneficial arrangements, annuities are in all cases paid, amounting in some instances to more than $30 for each individual of the tribe, and in all cases sufficiently great, if justly divided and prudently expended, to enable them, in addition to their own exertions, to live comfortably. And as a stimulus for exertion, it is now provided by law that "in all cases of the appointment of interpreters or other persons employed for the benefit of the Indians a preference shall be given to persons of Indian descent, if such can be found who are properly qualified for the discharge of the duties."

<p>
Such are the arrangements for the physical comfort and for the moral improvement of the Indians. The necessary measures for their political advancement and for their separation from our citizens have not been neglected. The pledge of the United States has been given by Congress that the country destined for the residence of this people shall be forever "secured and guaranteed to them." A country west of Missouri and Arkansas has been assigned to them, into which the white settlements are not to be pushed. No political communities can be formed in that extensive region, except those which are established by the Indians themselves or by the Untied States for them and with their concurrence. A barrier has thus been raised for their protection against the encroachment of our citizens, and guarding the Indians as far as possible from those evils which have brought them to their present condition. Summary authority has been given by law to destroy all ardent spirits found in their country, without waiting the doubtful result and slow process of a legal seizure. I consider the absolute and unconditional interdiction of this article among these people as the first and great step in their melioration. Halfway measures will answer no purpose. These can not successfully contend against the cupidity of the seller and the overpowering appetite of the buyer. And the destructive effects of the traffic are marked in every page of the history of our Indian intercourse  . . .
