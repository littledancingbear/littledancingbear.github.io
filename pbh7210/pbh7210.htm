AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
</font>

<p>
To develop knowledge, understanding and skills in the area of Indigenous health both 
global and local. The main focus is health and health care of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander peoples in Australia. Students will gain an appreciation of both historical and contemporary issues impacting on the mortality and morbidity rates of Indigenous peoples in Australia as well as worldwide, through a study and analysis of:

<ul type=disc>
<li>
Traditional Indigenous cultures
<li>
The history and impact of cultural collisions with Europeans, and
<li>
The changing nature of Indigenous lifestyles within different social, geographical and cultural boundaries.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The subject also aims to:

<ul type=disc>
<li>
Foster an understanding of traditional cultures and medicine 
<li>
Foster an understanding of the impact of Western society on the social, spiritual, physical and emotional well being of Aboriginal peoples nationally and internationally.
<li>
Provide a basis for further study of cultural contact, race relations and health issues relating to Indigenous people globally and Aboriginal people within Australia
<li>
Analyse the social, political and economic effects of collisions of culture on policies pertinent to Aboriginal peoples and their responses
<li>
Analyse Indigenous health from an historical perspective to highlight the interaction between health, well being, economic sustainability, cultural preservation and community development for Indigenous Australians
<li>
Through an historical analysis of Indigenous health and Western medical practices, focus attention upon the interaction between health, health care professionals and para-professionals and Indigenous health care practices in Australia.
</li>
</ul>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION
</font>

<p>
Through the introduction of Indigenous perspectives on Indigenous health, this subject is designed to facilitate a shift in knowledge and awareness amongst non Indigenous public health, medical and paramedical practitioners and other health care service providers, regarding the plight of Indigenous Peoples in the world and particularly in Australia, which has high mortality and morbidity rates in communities throughout the country.

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<p>
<font size="+2">
CONTENT
</font>

<p>
Students will be guided through a number of areas in the field of health, economics, political factors and social issues that influence the access of Indigenous peoples to appropriate health, health care and health care practitioners.

<p>
This subject particularly identifies and examines the distinguishing features of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and investigates the attitudes, policies and actions of the consecutive Governments since colonisation in 1788.  Students will gain an insight into the history of contact between Indigenous/non-Indigenous people, government policies developed for Indigenous people and the resulting social and health ramifications.

<p>
Through an assessment of social demographics, generic factors and cultural values, students will gain an insight into variables such as identity, spirituality and traditional means of health and healing. These factors form the core of what it is to be Indigenous and how this impacts on the lifestyles and lives of Aboriginal people in the Australian and global contexts.

<p>
Issues such as cultural and social pluralism, genocide, cultural diversity, marginalisation, multiculturalism, ethnocentrism, will be covered throughout the subject and contextualised into the field of Indigenous health and the health of Indigenous peoples.

<p>
<hr>
</p>

<font size="+2">
ORGANIZATION AND TEACHING METHODS
</font>

<p>
Weekly workshops are offered on Nathan Campus. Students are requested to attend the workshops. Teaching methods include lectures, workshops, seminars, group work and exercises.

<p>

</p>

<font size="+2">
ASSESSMENT
</font>

<p>
Assessment will be based on three items. Each item must be undertaken, with relevant documentation submitted before a final grade for the subject can be awarded.

<p>
It is important for students to note due dates for each assessment item and ensure that each item is submitted by the due date. Requests for extensions will not be granted unless prior approval is prior to the due date or unless extenuating circumstances can be cited.

<p>
Students must choose a different topic for each of the three assessment items.  Students may choose an area of interest in Indigenous health not covered in the topic list supplied.

<p>
<b>Assessment 1</b> will involve the analysis of a topic pertinent to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, the findings of which will be presented in seminar format.

<p>
Successful completion of this assessment item will depend on demonstrated knowledge of core concepts and findings and the ability to integrate that knowledge into a seminar with a primary health care, service delivery or clinically oriented focus.

<p>
The weighting for assessments item 1 is 20%.

<p>
<b>Assessment 2</b> will require students to research a particular area of Indigenous health in line with the core topics and prepare a report and annotated bibliography. The annotated bibliography will enable students to collect, collate, and share relevant literature on the their research topic.

<p>
The weighting for assessment item 2 will be 50%.

<p>
<b>Assessment 3</b> is a case study.  Students are required to attend an Indigenous community health agency to investigate a particular area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health in line with core topics but not covered in assessment items one or two.

<p>
The weighting for assessment item 3 will be 30%.

ADMINISTRATION
</font>

<p>
1.	Assessment items must be submitted through the boxes of Griffith Flexible Learning Service (Nathan Campus) by 03:00 pm of the due date, or by post if prior agreement of subject convenor has been obtained, but not by facsimile. 

<p>
2.	If students wish to submit assessment items with any similar material for two or more subjects, they must first seek approval of all subject convenors. Failure to do so could be interpreted as cheating. 

<p>
3.	Students should note that submission of an assignment represents an affirmation that it is all their own work and that nothing has been copied from the work of others except where appropriately referenced. 

<p>
4.	Late Penalties: The penalty for late submission or assessment items if 10% of that total assessment mark for the item per day, of the total marks for the item unless otherwise specified in the subject outline. No assignments will be accepted after the one week period. A Special Consideration form must be completed and submitted to the School of Public Health office if students request waiver of the late penalty or an extension to an assessment item. Extensions may be granted for medical conditions, however extensions will not be granted for work commitments, family commitments or computer failure. 

<p>
5.	Special Consideration: Students applying for special consideration (due to medical or other grounds) for assessment items must complete the appropriate application form available in the School of Public Health Office (Logan Campus, Academic 1, Level 4) or the Gumurrii Centre (Nathan Campus). Special consideration is not retrospective and students should submit Special Consideration forms as soon as they experience any difficulties, which may interfere with study or examination performance. It is expected that any applications for special consideration will be received by 24 hours after the date of examination.

With particular reference to Indigenous health, discuss these statements and analyse factors that decipher the myth from reality

Identify factors that have contributed to the development of maintenance of Indigenous health/ill-health over the past 10 years and discuss their effectiveness.
