Change: how?
</font>

<p>
If change is to be enacted for Indigenous peoples, past practices of isolation and cultural bias from institutions and society generally, must be addressed.

<p>
In social institutions such as medicine and health care, education and justice, historical processes have compounded the disadvantage that Indigenous peoples have for too long experienced.  Institutional research, education, appropriate provision of services and unbiased interpretations are all factors that must be addressed, if change is to occur for Indigenous peoples.

<p>
In bringing about change it is no longer sensible to isolate the subjects from the processes that will enhance change.  They must be viewed, not the problem in itself, but as a part of the solution and be included in processes in determining solutions.

<p>
To be strategic and relevant, researchers and research projects must be oriented to the solutions of problems being faced by Indigenous communities and community controlled health services.  The lack of academic credentials must not be a barrier to such people taking a role in Indigenous health research.  There is a need for training opportunities, for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, to build skills and understanding in relation to Aboriginal health research.

<p>
If medical and public health research is to contribute to redressing the health disadvantages of Indigenous Australians then the current health system must be seen as a part of the problem as well as part of the solution.

<p>
Given the history of control, isolation from decision making process and the limited availability of human and economic resources to enable them to be totally independent form any assistance form non-Indigenous professionals, Indigenous Australians are only too conscious of the need for collaboration and support.  They cannot however, allow the past dominance and isolation to continue.

<p>
Self-determination dictates a sense of contribution and ownership of resolutions by individual and community concerns.  The maturation of race relations and the effectiveness of initiatives in Indigenous health should be based fundamentally on such principles.

<p>
The debate of intellectual ownership will be fraught with issues that may or may not be difficult to overcome.  The resolution is in the hands of those involved and calls for a revision of past practices and the subsequent flaws that have been divulged.

<p>
"The world is a stage and we must each play a part", no more apt is this, than in the world of sharing knowledge, cultural diversity and intellectual acknowledgment and respect.

<p>
To advocate that some good has not been gained from research for Indigenous peoples would be misleading.  Research is however, a significant element in the carriage of knowledge, how it is interpreted and passaged through to enact change.

<p>
Research in itself cannot bring about change.  It can explore particular information, which by way of carriage and interpretation can lead to significant changes in the socialisation of institutions and to the betterment of the individual and the broader community.  That after all is fundamental principles of research.

<p>
Herein lie the flaws in historical research involving Indigenous peoples.
