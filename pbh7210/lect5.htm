<p>
Epidemiology is the study of the frequency, distribution and determinants of health and illness; the patterns of disease occurrence in human populations and the factors, which influence these patterns (McMurray 1993 p.184).

<p>
Epidemiological investigation is aimed at preventing and controlling strategies, it is primarily observational rather than theoretical and as such data collected is both descriptive and substantive.  Therefore observing, recording and collecting information can provide an insight into the distribution of health risks in a community; the types of people who are at risk of developing health problems. The conditions, disabilities or needs they have; and the services and health care providers they use for their health problems (McMurray 1993).

<p>
Morbidity refers to the number of people in a certain population affected by a disease or condition and it is described in terms of incidence and prevalence (McMurray 1998).

<p>
Mortality refers to the number of deaths from the illness or disease (McMurry 1998).

<br>

Definitions of Health, Healing and Well Being
</font>

<p>
Health has been described in many ways. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as "state of physical, mental and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (WHO 1974:1). In 1998, the World Health Assembly added "spiritual well-being" to this definition.

<p>
While the WHO provides a broad definition of health, medical personnel and allied health professionals continue to adopt a curative approach - the medical model - treating illness from ethnically defined and professionally prescribed principles.

<p>
The popular misconception of Indigenous health is that of high infant mortality, malnutrition and alcoholism. Publicity about these problems has become widespread, giving the general perception credibility and a sense of urgency. Dying babies and hungry children offend our sensibilities. It is also a popular misconception that inappropriately large sums of money are expended on Aboriginal In fact,  a health review put Commonwealth health care expenditure for Aboriginal people at some 25% less per head than the general population (Couzos & Murray, 1999). Public concern with these issues has successfully directed attention away from the problem to its symptoms 

<p>
To understand the state of Indigenous health, a closer examination of the cause and effects is warranted.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Holistic orientation - Indigenous health decline
</font>

<p>
While traditional Aboriginal society lived on bush tucker a diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat, with the influence of Western culture on Aboriginal peoples through removal processes or limitations imposed by legislation, they moved to a typical western diet high in fat and refined foods.

<p>
Most of the illnesses, diseases and disorders that affect Indigenous people today were unknown here before European contact. Indigenous people had no resistance to the introduced diseases - measles, chicken pox, smallpox and sexually transmitted diseases - and these diseases contributed to the sharp decline in health and lead to the deaths of large portions of the population. With dispossession of their traditional homelands came social and mental malaise, which manifested in apathy, vulnerability, alcoholism, substance abuse and subsequent ill health.

<p>
The transition from semi-nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle and its associated problems - overcrowding, inadequate hygiene and sanitary facilities - contributed to today's unsatisfactory health situation. Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity are prevalent, which in turn lead to coronary heart disease. Serious diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis were common until the 1980s, but are less in evidence today. A comprehensive immunization program reduced the risk of death from communicable diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles and whooping cough.

<p>
Despite substantial funding having been injected into education, prevention and treatment programs, intestinal and respiratory infections, parasitic diseases, malnutrition, anemia, skin infections, sexually transmitted infections and diseases of the eye, as well as social and stress related conditions such as depression, continue to be a major problem in Indigenous people.

<p>
Defining health and ascertaining the quality of health standards, or the cause of ill health in any given society, is based on cultural perspectives. While health, in Western terms is often physically, socially and psychologically defined, in Indigenous cultures, it is more holistically based with the spiritual, psychological, social, environmental and physical elements all intrinsically linked and aligned.

<p>
For Indigenous peoples, the connection to land, spirituality, kin and the metaphysical elements of their existence, were based on ceremonies and rituals to identify, isolate and treat ill health when it occurred. Disruption of traditional patterns of health and healing, introduced illnesses and diseases, socio-economic and political factors not previously experienced by Indigenous people, have all compounded the trauma of Indigenous peoples and placed them in a state of emotional and physical ill-being.

<p>
Health care came under the control of non-Indigenous practitioners. They were responsible for transposing a medical system developed in the Western industrialised world, to a people who shared neither culture, the disease profile nor the aspirations of the colonisers. This in itself compounded the propensity of Indigenous Australians to suffer from ill health.

<p>
Health professionals have focused on medical services, nutrition, housing, public utilities or preventive health measures. Anthropologists have studied authority structures, religious life, social controls which gave form and integrity to traditional Indigenous society, the alienation from land and the stresses of life on crowded missions and settlements. Historians explained the health troubles of the present in terms of insults of the past: the early introduction of diseases such as small pox and measles which wiped out some populations; the massacres (which continued well into the 1920s), the relocation of healthy, independent people onto ill-serviced, unhygienic settlements; the removal of children from their families; and the confused and conflicting interests which shaped ineffective and harmful policies and procedures. The current patterns of Indigenous morbidity and mortality are the product of myriad historical, social, structural, economic and political forces, making it impossible to pinpoint a cause, or remedy, in a simple way.

<p>
Indigenous health has declined dramatically with contemporary health status being regarded as congruent with the Third World. Indigenous Australian health indicators are considerably worse than those of comparable "first nation" peoples, in particular Indigenous populations of Canada and the United States, and New Zealand Maoris.

<p>
Indigenous Australians are more likely to be sick, injured or disabled and to die prematurely than non-Indigenous Australians. While indicators point to Indigenous child health improving slowly, despite much research and substantial funding, health of the adult population (from age 25 onwards), has deteriorated over the last two decades and introduced a new level of concern.

<p>
Major health concerns are:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Heart disease and stroke
<li>
Respiratory disease (including pneumonia)
<li>
Cancer
<li>
Injuries including motor vehicle, homicide and suicide
<li>
Endocrine, nutritional disorders, particularly diabetes.
<li>
Smoking
<li>
Higher morbidity and mortality rates for Indigenous Australians than for mainstream
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hospital admission patterns follow mortality patterns with relatively high levels of admissions for conditions such as NIDDM, hypertension, pneumonia, chronic obstructive airways disease (other than asthma), rheumatic heart disease and injury inflicted by others. Hospital admissions for these conditions do not correlate with corresponding mortality ratios. This suggests that access to hospital services by Indigenous people is not as high as it should be, given the high level of illness. 

<p>
Historical means of dealing with illness and disease in Indigenous communities have been ineffective. More innovative approaches that include Indigenous input and healing processes that are culturally acceptable must be instigated.

<p>
Other factors affecting overall health:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
High unemployment
<li>
Homelessness
<li>
Early exit from schooling
<li>
Family violence
<li>
Alcohol and substance abuse
<li>
Indigenous Aetiology 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The therapy selected by an individual or group is closely related to their theories of disease causation or aetiology. People from different societies classify disease and illness in different ways, and this is instrumental in their choice of treatment and the way disease or illnesses are perceived. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Health risks 
</font>

<p>
The concept of health risk is somewhat ambiguous when applied to Indigenous people. Their notion of health is broader than definitions proposed by health professionals. When Indigenous people speak of health, it is usually referring to well being.

<p>
Health professionals discuss compliance with treat regimes yet there is little motivation to comply with prescribed treatments, which are difficult to comprehend because of culturally inappropriate frames of reference. Indigenous people see their health not in terms of epidemiological cause and effect, but in terms of disharmony between what they define as health and well being and choices that have been imposed upon them by forces outside their culture.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Status Quo or moving forward - partnerships in Indigenous Health
</font>

<p>
Indigenous assessment of health and well being is not couched in Western epidemiological terms but rather things spiritual. To address the problems inherent in health services provided for Indigenous people, concerns of the past must be identified and strategies for the future implemented.

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Most non-Indigenous health professionals are poorly informed about Indigenous people, their cultural differences, their socio-economic circumstances and historical factors leading to the ill health of the Indigenous population. Cultural awareness workshops, including pre-service and in-service, for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals should be mandatory, especially in areas of high Indigenous population.

<p>
<li>
The rotation of staff through country hospitals means that many professional staff are ill-prepared to provide appropriate health care to rural Indigenous people. Staff on such rotations should receive special training for these placements and resources to make this possible should be routinely provided as part of the operating budgets of relevant facilities.

<p>
<li>
The Primary Health Care approach to health development is highly appropriate in the Indigenous health field, but health professionals are not well trained in this area. Pre-service and in-service training of doctors, nurses and allied health professionals should provide such staff with a firm understanding of and commitment to, Primary Health Care. This should be a special feature of the training of staff likely to work in localities where Indigenous people are concentrated.

<p>
<li>
Health care staff working in areas of high Indigenous population  should receive specific orientation training covering both the socio-cultural aspects of the Indigenous communities they are likely to be serving and the types of medical and health conditions likely to be encountered in a particular locality. Such orientation programs must be complemented by appropriate on the job training.

<p>
<li>
Effective communication between non-Indigenous health professionals in mainstream services, and patients is essential for the successful management of the patients' health problems. Non Indigenous staff should receive special training to sensitize them to the communication barriers most likely to interfere with the optimal professional/patient relationship.

<p>
<li>
To understand Indigenous health or ill health, a knowledge of the aetiology is imperative. To assist with this understanding, Indigenous health workers and communities must be involved at all levels.  

<p>
<li>
More attention must be given to the provision of Primary Health Care in Indigenous communities.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Improving Indigenous health status is a difficult and complex task. Effective health promotion must include comprehensive and multi-layered strategies that seek to redress social inequities in all aspects of life including education, justice, employment and land rights. Health education must be presented in forms, structures, settings and language that local Indigenous community members can identify with. This process must begin with an understanding of Indigenous cultures and community defined goals that may or may not always correspond with those suggested by the wider community (Saggers & Gray, 1992).

<p>
Without such attention, and the empowerment of Indigenous people, future action to address Indigenous ill health will be primarily futile.

<br>
<br>

<font size="+1">
Discussion points
</font>

<ul type=disc>
<li>
Isolate one aspect of Indigenous health and analyse it from what may be an Indigenous perspective.  How does this differ from a non Indigenous perspective?
<p>
<li>
Analyse what may be appropriate variables in treating and diagnosing ill health in Indigenous communities. In responding, address what may be culturally defined variables and their impact on Western and Indigenous intervention.
</li>
</ul>
