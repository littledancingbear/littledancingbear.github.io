Introduction
</font>

<p>
The concept of health from an Indigenous perspective is somewhat different to that proposed by many health professionals.  When Indigenous people discuss health it is through a window of "well being" (McMurray, 1998).  The concept of well being incorporates all facets of social, economic and spiritual life.  These factors have an interrelatedness, which means that a breakdown in one part of this system has flow on effects to other areas.  Central to this well being is land.

<p>
Traditional Indigenous people maintained a balanced harmonious life, which reflected a state of well being adhering to the dreaming and territorial security.  Events after the arrival of European settlers disrupted essential relationships, promoted dispossession of land established a pattern downward spiralling health for Indigenous people.

<p>
Reid and Trompf (1991) raise the issue of provision of service with incorrect assumptions.  These being:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
That Aboriginal society is culturally simplistic.
<li>
That western medicine is superior to Aboriginal traditions of health care.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Both of these ideals originate from 19th century social theory focusing on the infallibility of western medicine and Darwin's theory of evolution categorising Indigenous people as being primitive and uncivilised.  Though outdated, these schools of thought are still underlying understanding of Indigenous health.

<p>
A close view of Indigenous holistic health or well being is therefore warranted to extrapolate the ideas of a traditional health system.  We will briefly outline the spiritual, social and economic dimensions of traditional Indigenous society.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Spiritual Dimension
</font>

<p>
Traditional Indigenous society believed that children were born from women but conceived of a spiritual source via the land.  The land has physical properties but also spiritual properties.  Land, as such, is a parent and this makes you part of that land and accordingly, it cannot be traded, sold or abused.  It is not an asset in the sense that can be accumulated rather it is part of you and you are part of it.  It is a spiritual landscape on which ancestors travelled and created a code to live by.  This code is referred to today as the Dreaming a living dynamic law passed on via stories, dance and other forms.

<p>
This dimension of Indigenous society is specific to the regions of the particular clan in question.  The physical attributes such as landscape features plants and animals have spiritual connections, through the dreaming, explaining the formation of sites and the reasons why particular areas and animals have special significance.  These lores have ensured ongoing survival.  The strong spiritual bond is still intact for most Aboriginal people and is highlighted in the desire for people to maintain contact or return periodically to traditional areas.  The failure of the west to acknowledge and allow this essential need is a major source of Aboriginal illness.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Social Dimension
</font>

<p>
Indigenous Australians relationship to the land is similar to relationships with each other.  The social organisations were not based in small groups or units but in larger clans.  The clans moved in designated clan areas according to seasonal variations.  Each clan was not an isolated pocket but was linked to other clans via marriages and other religious or economic activities.  Each clan, however, knows its own dreaming stories, land features and language.  These languages were estimated at around 500/600 prior to white settlement with approximately 300,000 people.

<p>
Indigenous people still maintain community and kinship ties.  This is demonstrated in the attendance of mortuary rituals, community meetings and social gathering obligations. As a child, it was not uncommon in our household to have a whole family stay with us for extended periods of time.  There was never any indecision about when or where someone would sleep or who should pay for food and other issues.  It was just an obligation to provide any help possible to family and extended family.

<p>
A breakdown in these kinship networks on a large scale has had a catastrophic effect on Indigenous people. Disruption of linkages on a smaller scale, such as a stay in hospital may then in fact have the effect of being detrimental to the condition of an Indigenous person under care.  The trend has been, in recent years, to provide community based care wherever possible in line with Indigenous concepts of well being.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Economic Dimension
</font>

<p>
The principle of some form of trade is common amongst all humans and although Indigenous people have been perceived to be non-materialistic there are other units of trade.

<p>
The practice is a "non-equitable debt system" (Reynolds, 1989:91) similar to gift giving.  The units of trade may be material, service, responsibility or knowledge.  Once a unit has been passed it is seen as an obligation or debt to that person.  So in non-Indigenous society, individual collection of possessions displays wealth whereas in Indigenous society, a wealthy or respected person may in fact have the least possessions..

<p>
In this sense there is unwritten obligation between Indigenous people which is played out in traditional as well as contemporary Aboriginal society.  Several examples of this can be given in the health area such as the care given to elders as respected members of the community.  There never was any discussion in our house of finding alternate accommodation for grandparents or old aunties.  Our own people cared for them in an appropriate, culturally sensitive environment.  People diagnosed, in the western sense with a mental disorder, were not sent to an institution but rather cared for by our own people.  

<p>
This type of community based care is increasingly becoming more common as Western society sees the benefits of providing a type of health care congruent with the needs of the people being serviced.

<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Hunter/Gatherers  vs. Contemporary Society
</font>

<p>
The traditional patterns of life as harmonious as they are, are at odds with contemporary western society to accept Indigenous concepts of holistic health will continue to provide inadequate care for Indigenous people.  A juxtaposition of Indigenous vs. Western perceptions of some of these factors may be useful:

<p>
This table displays the inherent differences between some aspects of Indigenous and dominant western culture.  While it is realised the advances of modern medicine have obvious benefits for Indigenous Australians, the inability to construct this in an Indigenous perspective of holistic health care leaves the system open to ultimate failure.  In a changing environment we must accept many of the benefits of Western health techniques but not at the expense of our own culture.  That is why it is imperative that we become useful partners in the construction of an effective health system.

Conclusion
</font>

<p>
It seems clear that if Indigenous health is to improve Indigenous participation must be increased.  Although it is folly to suggest a return totally to traditional practices, the strength of Indigenous beliefs and values is the basis of improved healing for the future.  Coombs (1994) makes these points.  The emergence of Indigenous health services success is based on the following principles:

<ul type=disc>
<li>
Indigenous control
<li>
Emphasis on positive environmental aspects of health
<li>
Emphasis on Aboriginal health workers as primary instrument of service delivery
<li>
Use of western medical technology 
<li>
Respect for, and use of traditional Aboriginal medical knowledge (Coombs, 1994: 64)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This uses major facets of traditional Indigenous society to facilitate improved health services.  It emphasises the principle of self-determination and essential Indigenous involvement through the use of Indigenous health workers under the direction of Indigenous people.  This reacquaints people with cultural and social obligations using the correct protocols within social organisation.  It also stresses a partnership with the use of western technology and the Indigenous community having more control.  It also refers to the unconditional acceptance and respect for Indigenous knowledge of health including positive environmental mental aspects.  This strategy encompasses the major dimensions discussed previously of spiritual and social factors and to a lesser extent economic. 

<p>
To effectively address the concerns of Indigenous health, Indigenous Australians recognise the invaluable contributions of collaborative intervention and to this end, emphasis for future policies and programs should be based on the collective input of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous health care providers.
