If you want to understand the causes that existed in the past, look at the results as they are manifested in the present.  And if you want to understand what results will be manifested in the future, look at the cause that exist in the present.

<p>
The roots of contemporary Indigenous spirituality lie in traditions based on 40,000+ years of ceremonies and rituals enmeshed in a cyclical reverence of life, death and creation. At the time of European contact, Indigenous societies were based on complex systems of kinship and family obligations, rules of interaction and behaviours and social organisation. Indigenous spirituality was based on a sophisticated connection between knowledge, kinship and practices, all of which embraced the importance of survival and harmony with the environment and land. 

<p>
To protect, preserve and to pass cultural knowledge from one generation to the next, the early socialisation of Aboriginal children revolved around the acquisition of knowledge about spirituality rituals, ceremonies, obligations and responsibilities, all of which were central elements of individual and group identity.

<p>
While the effects of colonisation on Aboriginal life varied from area to area, many clans resisted the intrusion of the colonisers and suffered the consequences of family dispersal, dispossession of land, and in many instances, death.  Suffering from disease, malnutrition, many Aboriginal people succumbed to the enticement of shelter and food offered by the colonisers, often at their own detriment and peril.

<p>
Rounded up and placed on communal reserves and missions, the lives of many Indigenous people altered forever with the increasing dominance of western civilisation eroding many aspects of the traditional way of life.

<p>
While the enforced changes had devastating consequences on the culture as a whole, Indigenous people fought hard to retain their cultural identity and continued to practice the culture, often at their own peril.  Hidden by the elders from the managers of missions and others, who would inflict severe punishment if cultural practices were witnessed, many of the traditional beliefs and rituals were handed down through generations as secret business and a number of key cultural values were retained.

<p>
In the main, loss of language and traditional homelands resulted but reverence for the land, the embracing of family and kin and the deep sense of spirituality continue to form the basis of being Aboriginal in a modern world. Tormented by the traumas of the past and suffering cultural alienation, many Aboriginal people are in a state of distress and grieving for elements of their heritage that can never be retrieved.  For these people and the remainder of the Aboriginal communities, sorry business, grieving, is a constant presence in their lives.

Recognising the present - exposing the wounds - healing for the future
</font>

<p>
The essence of genocide is acting with the intention to destroy the group, not the extent to which the intention has been achieved.  A major intent of forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families and either placing them with non Indigenous families or in institutions was to assimilate them into mainstream society, so Aborigines as a distinct group would disappear. 

<p>
While colonial influences did much to destroy the traditional lives of Indigenous peoples, the dispossession of land and the erosion of family and kinship systems have had the most devastating consequences. Children separated from parents on reserves and raised in dormitories, the 'stolen generations', and removal from traditions has left succeeding generations without positive parental and family role models. Female children were trained as domestic servants to serve non-Indigenous landholders. They were often sent great distances from their natural families, did not receive wages and were sexually and physically abused by their employers. When they became pregnant, they were returned to their reserve to give birth when the baby was placed in a dormitory, and they were returned to the same or another employer for the process to continue. Indigenous youths were sent to work for landholders as cheap labour.

<p>
The legacy of this treatment has prevented many Aboriginal adults from forming a loving and bonding relationship with others and has contributed to suicidal and violent behaviours inflicted on self and others around them. Indigenous families traditionally, have been based on a system of defined rules of marriage, interaction and kinship, which determine for each member of the family, their role, their place, who they may marry and their responsibilities within the immediate and extended family and the community.

<p>
The disruption to the family units has resulted in a number of characteristics being present in the daily lives of many Aboriginal people:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Disempowerment
<li>
Vulnerability
<li>
Fear
<li>
Stress
<li>
Trauma
<li>
Shame
<li>
Punishment
<li>
Psychological and physical abuse
<li>
Insecurity and lack of self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, depression and suicide
<li>
Delinquency, crime and violence often leading to imprisonment 
<li>
Alcohol or drug abuse 
<li>
Lack of trust and intimacy
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the parents of the stolen generations the consequences have been equally as devastating.  Many families had more than one of their children taken away. Even when the parent was present when the child or children were taken away, their struggles to protect those children often resulted in them being punished and branded a trouble maker and subsequently imprisoned or forced onto a mission or reserve. Many parents who had their children taken away resorted to false means of comfort, chiefly alcohol, as a way to alleviate their hurt and their pain. 

<p>
Victims of the stolen generations often experience insecurity and lack of self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness.  Many have experienced depression and some have contemplated suicide, turned to alcohol and/or substance abuse and have found themselves imprisoned or the perpetrator or victim of acts of violence.

<p>
Many have experienced lack of trust, intimacy and the inability to form caring nurturing relationships and many have deep seated anger and frustration for being deprived of their traditional culture and kin.  No records were maintained of the children taken away or where they were taken so finding family and country has been a long and painful process. Because of the lack of records, the full extent of the numbers of removed children is not known.

<br>
<br>

Alcohol and substance abuse
</font>

<p>
The introduction of liquor on Indigenous communities has profoundly affected Aboriginal socio-cultural systems. To understand alcoholism, it is imperative that a deep understanding of the causes and simply not the effect is gained.  Increasingly Indigenous people have become socially and personally trapped in a cycle of prejudice and discrimination which has emanated from colonial experiences and is manifested in the myriad social concerns that affect them in contemporary society. The rate of alcoholism, in Indigenous communities, is abnormally high as a consequence of the devastated social system.  The prolonged consumption of alcohol has manifested in:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Family breakdown
<li>
Family violence
<li>
High crime, arrest and incarceration (with attendant deaths in custody) rates 
<li>
Suicide
<li>
Poor nutritional status
<li>
Lifestyle diseases
<li>
Mental disorders, stress, depression
<li>
Child neglect
<li>
Self neglect 
<li>
Social isolation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Yahndi  (marijuana) use is widespread in Australia and across Aboriginal communities (Donaghy, 1997:138) with new strains being introduced. Hydroponically grown marijuana is reportedly up to 25 times stronger than the crop grown 30-40 years ago and could induce psychotic symptoms after just one or two joints. The combination of Yahndi and alcohol presents a growing medical problem. (Hammill, 1999)

<p>
The contemporary experience of Indigenous people could leave many with the notion that there is a tendency for members of that culture to have a predisposition toward deviant and criminal behaviour.  Alternatively the assessment could be that Indigenous people posses a genetic or mental inferiority that renders them incapable of being able to act rationally or with responsibility.  The cause however, is that of social dislocation and disempowerment of Indigenous communities.

Loss - Sorry Business and Mourning
</font>

<p>
For Aboriginal peoples the death of a member or members of a traditional group is a loss shared by the entire community.  In dealing with the loss of a loved one, ritual moaning and wailing often takes place and can continue for prolonged periods of time to placate the troubled spirit of the deceased.  Once all these funeral rites are complete, there are often long term obligations connected with a death that must be adhered to depending on the responsibilities of the respective communities.

<p>
Death terminates a person's life cycle, in the physical sense but remains a factor, which must be integrated into the ongoing life cycles of the other people who are affected by it. Grieving for the deceased, fulfilling the claims of his or her will; finishing his or her unfinished business, and achieving a better passage for this is an all important responsibility in the grieving process for many people.

Effecting change in Indigenous Communities
</font>

<p>
Indigenous people are increasingly determining priorities.  Indigenous cultural resurgence has helped many non-Indigenous people to realise the value of Indigenous cultural heritage and to question any sense of their own superiority. For some Indigenous Australians, this resurgence has been made possible by the homeland movement where small groups have left settlements to reoccupy traditional land and to strengthen the socialization of their children.  For others the resurgence has been through the development of Aboriginal controlled services such as the medical centres and the legal services (Hollingsworth, 1998) and through education.

<p>
The ability of Indigenous peoples to achieve their aspirations, to deal with the trauma, to address the compounded hurt and to deal with the sorry business forever, will depend to the extent to which non-Indigenous service providers are able to comprehend and combat institutional and ideological racism which remain entrenched. 

<p>
Many programs have been put in place in Indigenous communities often providing the impression that much is being achieved. However, the failure of bureaucracy to properly implement and monitor these programs, the duplication of ineffective services and the publicity surrounding the few good practices in place, often provide a false impressions.

<p>
In most communities, the medical model of health has been presented as the norm rather than the Indigenous holistic model of well being. Consequently in many areas, Aborigines do not know what it is to be well.  Both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal service providers and medical staff must work collaboratively with communities to alleviate this concern.

Discussion Points
</font>

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
How can non-Indigenous specialists, medical staff and health care providers assist with de-traumatising individuals in the Indigenous communities without breaking cultural protocol?
<li>
What ramifications would there be for Indigenous health care staff when bereavement in the community occurs?
<li>
What initiatives or procedures could be developed to help deal with and alleviate the sorry business (trauma and grieving) in the Aboriginal communities?
</li>
