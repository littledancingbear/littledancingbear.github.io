<blockquote>
Our society is one not of spectacle, but of surveillance; under the surface of  images one invests bodies in depth; behind the great abstraction of exchange, there continues the meticulous, concrete training of useful forces; the circuits of communication are the supports of an accumulation and centralisation of knowledge; the play of signs defines the anchorages of power; it is not that the beautiful totality of the individual is amputated, repressed, altered by our social order, it is rather that the individual is carefully fabricated in it, according to a whole range of forces and bodies. (Foucault a:217) 
</blockquote>  

<p>
Since the beginning of time, the acquisition of knowledge has been guided by theoretical school of thought and inquiry.

<p>
The manner in which knowledge is interpreted has been guided by variables such as

<ul type=disc>
<li>
gender bias
<li>
socialisation
<li>
professional bias
<li>
world views
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The way in which knowledge is acquired, how it is interpreted and the methods of disseminating such information, can be subject to manipulation and bias. Driven by principles of cultural persuasion, the use of knowledge and the interpretation of subsequent data, can render groups in society susceptible to exploitation, abuse and control.    

<p>
Research and theory are intrinsically linked in a continuum of investigatory and interpretational processes mutually joined by respective schools and persuasions. Research in itself is guided by a set of ethical standards that denote responsibility toward colleagues, sponsors and subjects. Such alliance determines respective methods of data collection and interpretation. For Indigenous peoples, this process has not always been to their betterment or advantage. 

<p>
Depicted as unintelligent and "savage like' by colonial writers and research, Indigenous Australians have suffered a history of abuse legitimised by theoretical alliances.

<p>
The acquisition of knowledge and the manner in which it is used is guided by cultural principles.  Subjected to ongoing research and investigation over many years, exposed to the cultural interpretations of the researchers and alienated from the research process, the lives of Indigenous peoples have been consistently determined by interpretations external of their cultural realm.

<p>
While humanity has gained through the historical research that has been conducted, the experience of Indigenous peoples has not always been positive.  Based on ethnocentric and biased principles, historical research legitimised the discrimination of Indigenous peoples, made prominent by scientific and medical ascertains of the time.

<br>

Knowledge, Diversity and Cultural Perspectives
</font>

<p>
Knowledge from an Indigenous perspective represents the possession of a set of responsibilities held on behalf of the family unit of community.  This knowledge was passed down through generations and was acquired only after individuals reached a position in life whereby they were entitled to responsibilities and obligations.  Such responsibilities were often on the individual preservation of knowledge about culture, about time and land and its relevance to social existence in respective clans and kin.

<p>
The possessor of the knowledge took on the role of gatekeeper and was respected by all for having reached the particular stage in life.  Sharing the knowledge with others outside of the culture was as a major breach in ethical and cultural responsibilities, if the correct protocols were not adhered to.

<p>
Methods of preserving, and passing down cultural knowledge, sacred women's business and men's business, stories and information of the environment and the world in which they live has been an integral element in Indigenous communities since the beginning of time. Like secrets passed from generation to generation in Western families, Indigenous communities have traditionally relied upon the oral transmission of knowledge as a means of socialising their young and preserving their sacred and traditional practices and knowledge. Group survival in Indigenous communities often depended on such knowledge and practices.

<p>
Knowledge in non-Indigenous terms, symbolises the possession of power, profit and to a significant degree, privilege and socioeconomic advantage (Smith, 1997).  Used to isolate those that fail to meet social norms and obligations, knowledge and the written word perpetuates the values of social institutions designed to protect the interests of the dominant majority. For cultures outside of the Western world, this situation has had serious consequences with regard to historical and contemporary experiences. 

<p>
The knowledge and information possessed by Indigenous communities has only recently been recognised for its worth by non-Indigenous researchers, historians and writers.  Historically, Indigenous knowledge was perceived to be without substance and with little to offer the community by way of intellectual contribution and experience.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Resurgence of Indigenous Inquiry
</font>

<p>
With increasing numbers of Indigenous graduates, managerial appointments in government and in the private sector, Indigenous communities are taking control of and monitoring the use of their own cultural knowledge. To safeguard the ongoing intrusion into Indigenous communities, Indigenous peoples have called for international measures to protect and preserve Indigenous cultural knowledge.

<p>
Analysing such points raises a number of fundamental questions:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Is there a need for education in the training of professionals'.?
<li>
Should more Indigenous Australians be involved in research projects that examine aspects of their communities or Indigenous issues?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each of these points warrants further discussion and analysis.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Areas of Concern
</font> 

<p>
Driven by questionable intent, past research practices have in many cases, been perceived to be manipulative of those being researched.

<p>
Researchers have taken the time to gain the trust of Indigenous people only to fail them when the research is complete.  Many non Indigenous researchers and service providers have investigated issues in Aboriginal communities, without approval or acknowledgment of or consultation with the people concerned.

<p>
In Indigenous communities there is a general cautiousness if someone from outside the community is present and positive interaction with outsiders does not occur until a sense of rapport and trust is developed.

<p>
The theft of Aboriginal skulls for scientific testing; the exploding of the atomic bomb by the British with little regard to the local Indigenous inhabitants; the unauthorized issuing of De Provera to Aboriginal women to control reproduction; the recent global DNA testing on Indigenous populations; the unauthorized use of secret traditional medicines and healing ceremonies are representative of ways in which Indigenous people have been subject to research.  Not all research has been undertaken in the same manner but these are examples of severe deficiencies in research methods and ethics. 

<p>
While there have been many gains made for Indigenous communities through research, past experiences have left many disillusioned and wary. Similar concerns have been raised by Indigenous communities across the world where the ethical principles of research on Indigenous issues have been questionable.

<p>
Despite a questionable history of race relations however, the attitudes of non Indigenous researchers working with Indigenous communities is now evidencing a level of respect and understanding of cultural protocols and procedures previously limited.

<p>
The right to cultural knowledge and identity is a basic human right.  As Indigenous Australians reclaim and name their cultural heritage, sharing what they will with the broader community, important ethical issues arise in both processing and product - who owns and controls knowledge and what for purpose will such knowledge be put in the future.

<p>
Many international organisations are exploring intellectual property rights and developing policies and guidelines to address the concerns of Indigenous peoples. 

<p> 
Such organisations include:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
The International Labor Organisation 
<li>
The United Nations General Assembly
<li>
The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) 
<li>
The World Bank
<li>
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) 
<li>
World Intellectual Property Organisation
<li>
Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants Food and Agriculture Organisation
<li>
United Nations Environment Program
<li>
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
<li>
International Union for the Conservation of Nature
<li>
United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples and
<li>
Many Indigenous non-Government organisations across countries.
</li>
</ul>

[Access to many of these organizations via: <a href="http://www.ldb.org/un.htm">http://www.ldb.org/un.htm</a>]

<p>
The issue of Indigenous Intellectual and cultural property rights has been bought to the attention of the United Nations and over the past number of years, action has been taken to develop an international 'Declaration of Indigenous Rights' to protect the knowledge of Indigenous peoples and to assist non-Indigenous researchers to understand the cultural protocols and obligations that needed to be adhered.

<p>
Indigenous intellectual property also encompasses traditional knowledge about environment, resources and practices.  Recent discussions at the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development have drawn attention to the need for recognition and protection of Indigenous environmental knowledge and practices.  These discussions have concerned, among other things, biotechnology, science and sustainable development, technology transfer, deforestation and maintenance of Biodiversity (ATSIC Website, 1999 <a href="http://www.atsic.gov.au/">http://www.atsic.gov.au/</a>).

<p>
Intellectual property is difficult to define.  It encompasses both intangible aspects such as ideas, styles and designs, and the physical manifestations of these such as works of art, songs and narratives.  It can be broadly considered an aspect of cultural property, which includes artifacts, and handicrafts, objects of spiritual significance, human remains and sacred sites.

<p>
If there is to be a collegial relationship fostered in the future between Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, recognising Indigenous input and providing appropriate feedback to those researched are two points that warrant more stringent monitoring and address.

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
What is the role of medical and public health research in overcoming the barriers to better health for Indigenous Australians?
<li>
What kind of research are needed and under what conditions?  What are the priority areas for such research?
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Consultation, Research and Collaboration
</font>

<p>
Consultation and self-determination are essential factors in Indigenous Health.  Issues such as; ownership of research material, Indigenous involvement in the research practices, Indigenous employment in research, and funding for research.  Thus directions for procedures and practices need to be established in order to achieve appropriate future development in the field.

<p>
Indigenous Australian researchers should be given the necessary skills and knowledge to carry out research in conjunction with Indigenous communities or organisations.  Collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous academics must be increased and mutual respect for intellectual input must be evident.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Emerging Paradigms - A New Approach to and Old Concern
</font>

<p>
More recently, researchers have been aware of the need to include those being researched in the research process. Paolo Freire's (1971) concept of participatory action research, using ethnographic documentation of the lived experience is being adopted and, in Indigenous communities, research carried out and data obtained is increasingly "conditional on sustained reciprocity" (Manderson, 1999:131). Research carried out is then not just about Indigenous people, it is for and by Indigenous people, with the researcher a tool for the betterment of both the community and the research (Hammill, 1999).

Discussion
</font>

<p>
With regard to health, health care delivery and health services for Indigenous Australians, discuss the following

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>
Indigenous health currently raises a number of political, social and economic concerns.  Identify factors that may have contributed tot he development, maintenance and status of Indigenous health over the past 10 years and analyse how research ethics, practices and methods, may have contributed to the current position.
<li>
Examine one aspect of Indigenous health that continues to be directly linked to the history of disempowerment and change in Indigenous communities.  How could the situation have been altered through community participation, professional and community collaboration, community based research and acknowledgment of intellectual ownership and responsibilities?
</li>
