Introduction
</font>

<p>
Although the <a href="http://www.who.int">World Health Organization</a> has defined the concept of health for all populations, the concept of health is dependent on the culture and world-view of the population being served.  

<p>
Before we learn about the concept of health among Indigenous peoples, and remember it differs from tribe to tribe, we should begin with some definitions and concepts that will ensure we are all thinking the same way. Because non-Indigenous people may have one way of thinking about something and Indigenous people may have another way of defining the same idea. 

<p>
For example what non-Indigenous people think about mental illness may be different that what Indian people think about it.  We often honor people who hear the spirits talk, but non-Indian people call this schizophrenia.  If these people are not dangerous, often they live peacefully in our communities while non-Indians lock them up in hospitals.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
Indigenous People
</font>

<p>
Who are the world's Indigenous people? In 1977 the second general assembly of the World Council of Indigenous People (WCIP) passed a resolution declaring that only Indigenous peoples could define Indigenous peoples.  We know who we are and we are unique.  The formal political definition developed by WCIP is: 

<p>
Indigenous people shall be people living in countries which have populations composed of different ethnic or racial groups who are descendents of the earliest populations which survive in the area, and who do not, as a group, control the national government of the countries within which they live (WCIP - <a href="http://www.halcyon.com./FWDP/wcip.html">http://www.halcyon.com./FWDP/wcip.html</a>) 

<p>
When Indigenous people from different cultures meet one another for the first time we are overwhelmed by the fact that we share the same basic culture in spite of overt difference. What makes us different from the dominant society is the relationship to the land.  "There can be no economic interest superior to the necessity of preserving the ecosystem; we do not want a bonanza today at the cost of a desolate future" (Carduno, 1980).

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
ENVIRONMENT/ LAND
</font>

<p>
<font size="+1">
The Earth Mother
</font>

<p>
We are all thankful to our Mother, the Earth, for she gives us all that we need for life. She supports our feet as we walk about upon her. It gives us joy that she continues to care for us as she has from the beginning of time. To our mother, we send greetings and thanks. Now our minds are one. (Mohawk Prayer).

<p>
For Indigenous peoples, knowledge of the environment depends on contracts with the invisible spirit world, which plays its own crucial part in ensuring the reproduction of society, culture, and the environment.  Whereas non-Indigenous environmentalists deal exclusively with the relationship of human beings and "nature", Indigenous peoples have a different way of conceptualizing this. Knowledge is both spiritual and conceptual and human beings are not separated from what non-Indigenous people view as the "natural world" (Gray, 1991).

<p>
Although our Indigenous cultures vary from continent to continent, the concept of Earth as Mother or land as the ashes of our ancestors unites Indigenous peoples around the globe. 

<p>
For The Westerner, the Earth is something that can be given away, sold, pawned, mortgaged.  Not for us.  We can't touch the Earth, because it doesn't belong to us.   It is the property of the gods who have given it to us.  We Easter Islanders say, " How generous is Earth because when one of us dies, that person is gathered up in the womb or the Earth" (Chavez, 1997, 63).

<p>
We have an ancient and deep respect for the environment, embodied in the spiritual concept of Earth as Sacred Mother. We believe that She gives us everything we need to live: healing plants, animals, berries for food, clean water, clean air. Our art, our cultural ceremonies and our life ways all reflect this. For American Indians, we believe that the grasses are our mother's hair. When we burn our sweet grass in ceremonies the smoke carries our prayers to the Creator, much like the candles and the incense in other religious ceremonies. 

<p>
So Mother Earth takes care of us, gives us everything that is good. To survive, we take care of her. We all need care. It is what cements our relationships with one another. We need to care for the earth, for our people, our students, and we need the earth to care for us. 

<p>
In the past, the health problems that Indigenous peoples experienced were not of the magnitude of the many health problems currently developing in our environment. We never took more than we needed, and always gave back to Mother when we took from her. A massive paradigm shift, from the Indigenous concept of land caring in which we learned to work with the nature in a positive way to the concept in vogue today of the European idea of "sustainable development". For Indigenous Peoples, this is a conflict in cultural values, or a collision of cultures (Colomeda, 1998).

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
CULTURE
</font>

<p>
A long time ago, before Coyote or Raven made the world safe for people, all of the animals could talk to one another in a common language.

<p>
Ahh, but we can only tell coyote stories in the winter when there is snow upon the ground.  So, I have to begin in another way.

<p>
A long time ago, before the Europeans came to the Americas, there lived groups of people.  Each group lived in its own special way.  Each group developed its own laws, culture, customs and lifeways were adapted for survival of the people in whatever ecosystem they lived.  Each group depended on the plants and animals found in its area.  Some depended on the salmon, others hunted deer, moose, caribou or bison.  All of these cultural animals were used for food, for clothing, tools, cooking utensils, medicines, and other useful items.  Since my people come from the east coast of Canada, the Miramachi area of New Brunswick, I know that the special foods the <a href="http://www.ldb.org/vl/ai/mi'kmaq.htm">Mi'kmaq</a> depended on in the summer were eels, smelts, clams, lobsters and other sea foods.  In winter, they moved inland and hunted caribou, a deer species.  Even today, those foods are special foods of the east coast Indian people.  People in the plains areas of the now United States depended on the bison, and tribes on the west coast depended on the salmon.  Some tribal groups even made clothing from the skin of fish and birds.  The Mi'kmaq used the eel skin to set broken bones. It was used like an elastic stocking. 

<p>
For Indian People culture means, ceremonies, language, wisdom, songs, beliefs, healing practices, and values that have been handed down in the community from generation to generation.  Useful things like sewing bags, tool bags, even simple tools were highly decorated because this gave honor to the animals whose hides and bones were used to make the item.  Songs were sung to plants, and the value of that singing is scientifically proven today as plant specialists tell us that breathing near, and talking to plants gives them carbon dioxide.

<p>
The culture of many Indigenous peoples stems from an oral tradition; we use the word "theory" and make our own meaning for it. For me, it means, "The way our ancestors thought about things.  In pondering a theory of Indigenous health, I reflect on the meanings of balance between mind, body, spirit, culture and earth.  When these elements are in balance, we have good health.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
HEALTH PRACTICES, WISDOM, KNOWLEDGE
</font>

<p>
If an astrophysicist from earth discovered and communicated with an advanced civilization from a planet in a distant galaxy, a civilization light years ahead of earth in understanding wholeness and what heals their citizens, a civilization which has incorporated their planetary bio mass into healing as well as hundreds of millennia of expertise, that person feels we could learn much from such advanced civilization in a new world.

<p>
But the problem is we have that new world here on earth.  It is progressive and prosperous.  It was so even during Europe's Middle Ages, in the time of Columbus. This advanced civilization is the New World of North America's Indigenous civilization before contact with Europeans.  Health practices in Europe during the Middle Ages were cruel and perverse when compared with the healing rituals of the Incas, Mayans and other Indigenous people of the Americas during that same period in history.  Yet those scientists-explorers believed their way was far superior to that of civilizations in the New World (Colomeda 1998).

<p>
If we consider the profession of medicine today, it is clear that its major characteristic is preeminence.  Such preeminence is not merely that of prestige but also that of expert authority. That is to say, medicine's knowledge is considered to be authoritative and definitive (Freidson 1970, 7). 

<p>
Yet, the Indigenous people of the Americas knew many cures for illnesses long before medicine in Europe became a science. They knew about curing goiter by eating harvested sea kelp.  The iodine in the kelp kept them free from goiter. The Hurons taught the French explorer Jacques Cartier how to cure scurvy in the 1500s by boiling the needles from an evergreen tree.  The needles have high concentrations of Vitamin C.  In the 1700s James Lind of the Scottish navy learned about the Indians' cure from reading an account of Jacques Cartier and the Hurons.  Lind claimed the cure for himself (Weatherford 1988).

<p>
Indian people in northern California and Oregon used a medicine called the sacred bark to evacuate the bowels in cases of constipation.  The Spanish mixed the bark with sugar and chocolate.  Today, the same ingredients are found in a chocolate laxative known as Ex-Lax (Weatherford 1988). 

<p>
Curare originally came from the Indian people of the Amazon and was painted on the tips of arrows used to kill prey in the canopy of the rain forest.  Later it was used by western medicine to cure the symptoms of lockjaw.  Today it is used to relax the body before surgery so that the endotracheal tube can be inserted into the windpipe (Weatherford 1988).

<p>
Indian healers developed many drugs to treat the problems of women.  They used the Trillium erectum to ease the pain of childbirth, which lead the pioneers to rename the plant the "birthroot" (Weatherford 1988).

<p>
In addition Indian people developed many salves and ointments.  Among them are Witch hazel, Wintergreen and Vaseline.  Indian healers sewed facial lacerations by using bone needles threaded with human hair.  They set bones in eel skins and plasters made of downy feathers, gum and resin.  They gave enemas with rubber hoses and invented the bulb syringe to clean out ear canals (Weatherford 1988).

<p>
All of these healing activities were being implemented while medicine in Europe was focused on casting spells, removing the curses of devils, and other unlikely witchcraft.

Indigenous Health
</font>

<p align=right>
" To me, health is being spiritual, keeping in a good mind.  Keeping myself away from the "evil one," keeping spiritual, keeping strong." (Salish Cultural Leader)

<p align=right>
"The old people never wanted to go to the hospital.  To them, it was a scary place.  They thought they would never get out." (Salish Cultural Leader)

<p align=right>
 "Western medicine is so linear and not very conducive to healing [for me].  There is no connection to the spiritual aspect of healing [in Western medicine]." (Cree Cultural Leader)
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
CULTURAL EMPOWERMENT
</font>

<blockquote>
Cultural empowerment in health care, takes into account how health knowledge, beliefs, and actions are produced and interpreted at many levels, including individual, family, and community as well as grass roots. These interpretations also include international and national powers and politics (Airhihenbuwa 1995, 27). 
</blockquote>

<p>
When cultural contexts and values are not taken into account in health and development programs, their usefulness is questionable.  To locate culture within the heart of health education, promotion and provider, this is cultural empowerment. 

<p>
This process of empowering individuals in health education programming is often based on the assumption that individuals, primarily because of their limited economic resources, are powerless. Eurocentrists often consider silence, which makes most Westerners uncomfortable, to indicate voicelessness and weakness, failing to recognize that knowledge born of Western economic praxis carries questionable values and biases that marginalize traditional and local knowledge (Airhihenbuwa, 1995, 27-28). 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
CEREMONIES
</font>

<p>
Although many traditional ceremonies were lost and sacrificed to the collisions of culture, those that survive keep the people close to the Creator and to maintain the health of the people. There are many ceremonies in Indian culture. Some involve smoke or burning, such as smudging, the pipe ceremony. Other ceremonies involve fasting, vision quests, sweat lodge, Sun Dance. Some people used corn pollen, others used waters for purification. It is not my intention to tell you about all of the ceremonies, as they are sacred.  Some ceremonies were shared with non-Indian 
people.  For accounts of these, you can read the basics in anthropological works.  If you really want to learn, give up your job, go to live with a medicine person for the rest of your life. Then you will learn, if the medicine person wants to share.  

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
LANGUAGE
</font>

<p>
Like ceremonies, language is part of the culture, part of who we are.  Indian languages are beautiful, but many are dying out, becoming extinct.  We feel that when people know the language, then the culture will survive. Language is the vehicle, which transmits the culture to others.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
WISDOM/ KNOWLEDGE
</font>

<p>
Wisdom and knowledge are gifts that come from the Creator, which we are allowed to use for the good of the community.  Indian people never brag about what they know or about their skills and exploits.  If we are brave, people will know.  If we have power, people will know.  If we have courage, people will learn about it from others.  Wisdom and knowledge as well as morals and ethics are passed down from our elders.  When the elders think we are ready to learn something, they will tell us a story and we will know their meanings.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
COMMUNITY
</font>

<p>
The concept of community and connectedness is extremely strong in Indigenous cultures. The solutions we seek for our future do not lie in an individualistic form of thinking.  When people in our communities are ill, we bring the foods, medicines and we pray for them.  Rarely is this done in non-Indigenous communities.  The members of the community help form the worldview of all who live there.  It is closely related to culture.  Worldview consists of the principles that we acquire to make sense of the world around us.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
ANIMALS
</font> 

<p>
We gather our minds together to send greetings and thanks to all the Animal life in the world. They have many things to teach us as people. We are honored by them when they give up their lives so we may use their bodies as food for our people. We see them near our homes and in the deep forests. We are glad they are still here and we hope that it will always be so. Now our minds are one.  (Mohawk Prayer).

<p>
After Raven created humans, man came and stole his wife away.  So Raven went out and gathered rotten wood, pulverized it to a powdery dust, then scattered it in the air.  The particles became mosquitoes, which ever after plagued man (Nelson, 1983).

<br>
<br>

<p>
WHALES

<p>
All Indigenous cultures have special relationships with animals, which give themselves to us as food.  In Arctic Alaska where Inupiaq people have hunted the Bowhead whale since time is remembered, special ceremonies are observed even today during the whale hunt. 

<p>
One special ceremony occurs immediately when the whale is brought up from its home in the sea to the land. The wife of the whaler who killed the whale gives a glass of water to the dead whale.  This ceremony is done to appease the spirit of the whale and in doing so, more whales will give themselves up to be hunted.  

<p>
A long time ago, all parts of the whale were used for survival.  The oil was burned in lamps. The bones were carved and made into tools. The meat was food for the people.  The baleen was used for umbrellas and corset stays.  Today, whales are endangered because of over harvesting by non-Indigenous whalers.  So the whale hunt has become a memory except for the Inupiaq of Barrow and more recently, the Makah of Washington State.

<br>
<br>

<p>
BEARS

<p>
In Indigenous culture, bears are extremely sacred animals.  Across the circumpolar North, even into the boreal forests of Europe, the people share similar stories, hunting rituals, and legends about bears. We never call out the name "bear".  We call the bear "Grandfather."  When the fur is removed from the bear's body, it so resembles a human that we connect to it by calling it Grandfather.   People pray to bear spirits to gain strength, introspection and truth.

<p>
Many Native American initiation ceremonies suggest that Indian [people] associated initiation with hibernation.  Initiation was one of the more widespread of all Native American spiritual traditions.  The ceremonies, which encompassed puberty rites, the initiation of shaman, and the initiations of men and women into secret societies, were practiced by every tribe on the continent.  Rituals varied as did the myths supporting them, but a common pattern underlay the differences, and that pattern-prolonged isolation, fasting, symbolic death and rebirth-paralleled a bear in hibernation (Rockwell 1991, 10).

<p>
Polar bears seem to dance with one another when they play-fight.  They are so spiritual and beautiful when they dance. Many Inuit carvers of Arctic Canada are also inspired by the dance of the bears and carve Little Dancing Bears out of stone.

<p>
The strength of bear medicine lies in introspection.  It lies in the West on the Medicine Wheel.  Bears seek truth. The bear medicine attunes itself with the knowing.  To accomplish goals and dreams, the art of introspection is necessary. Bears have the capacity to quiet the mind, enter silence, through hibernation and to know.

<p>
Many tribes call the inner knowing, the Dream Lodge, where the death of the illusion of physical reality overlays expansiveness of eternity. The female energy that is contained in bear for centuries has allowed visionaries, mystics, and shamans to prophesy.

<p>
Bear is in the West, the right side of the brain, the intuitive side. Bear is the power of knowing and in becoming bear, you goals and dreams will be realized as concrete realities.  But you must enter the Dream Lodge and become silent so that you will hear the intuitive knowing. (Medicine Cards 1991).

<br>
<br>

<p>
CARIBOU

<p>
Among the Circumpolar forested areas of Europe and North America, the Caribou is the sacred animal and staple food source for the people.  In Europe, the caribou is called Reindeer and in North America it is known as caribou.  The difference is that reindeer can be trained and caribou cannot.  But they think they are the same animal as the males of one species readily mate with the females of the other and visa versa. 

<p>
Many stories, myths, and legends are told about caribou and reindeer.  The stories come from the people of the boreal forest areas.

<p>
Gwich'in means "people of the caribou", an apt name for a cultural group that largely relies on this mammal for a major part of its economic sustenance. Although the Gwich'in could not have survived over many centuries without the exploitation of smaller mammals, birds, and fish, caribou have always been the predominant feature of their way of life - culturally as well as economically.

<p>
This cultural affinity also has deep spiritual roots. Stories of ancient times describe how northern people lived in "peaceful intimacy," with all animals. When they became differentiated into distinct cultural groups, it was agreed that the Gwich'in would hunt the caribou. The modern day manifestation of this spiritual belief is that "every caribou has a bit of the human heart in him; and every human has a bit of caribou heart." As such, humans will always have partial knowledge of what the caribou are thinking and feeling; and equally, the caribou will have a similar knowledge of humans. Thus, at some times, hunting the caribou is very easy; while at other times, it is very difficult. In the hunting process, all creatures are to be respected. But with the exception of the bear, none are given higher recognition than the caribou. 

<p>                                  
The caribou meat is eaten three times daily. It is our main source of protein. Almost every part of the caribou is eaten. One of the few parts of the caribou not eaten is the lungs. The types of food that we make with the caribou are: dried meat, pemmican, hamburger, stew, and plain meat which is prepared in a variety of ways, such as frying, roasting, and making soup with the meat. A high protein diet is essential for surviving the harsh climate where the temperature can drop to -50 degrees Celsius for weeks and weeks.

<p>
Today, Gwich'in community members continue to rely on the caribou to meet both their subsistence and spiritual needs. The hunting and distribution of caribou meat also enhances their social interaction and cultural expression. When fresh meat is available, caribou will be consumed three or four times a day; the meat being shared throughout the community and region by a network of gift-giving arrangements as well as in trade for other goods. Caribou skins are used for winter boots, slippers, purses, bags, and other items of Native dress. Bones continue to be used as tools. Songs, stories, and dances, old and new, reverberate around the caribou further strengthening Gwich'in cultural life. 

<p>
The caribou skin can be tanned and people can make clothes from this skin, such as: mukluks, moccasins, parkas, coats, mitts, gloves, baby straps, belts, and other items.

<p>
We also make sinew which is long threads made out of the caribou. We use sinew as thread to sew the clothes together because it is very tough and strong. 

<p>
We use the caribou hide, with the hair left on, for a bed because it keeps you warm.

<p>
<a href="http://www.arctic-caribou.com/value.html">http://www.arctic-caribou.com/value.html</a>

<p>
Traditional people who hunt the caribou continue to live and abide by the hunting rules that were initiated by the elders so many years ago.  These are listed below: 

<p>
Caribou meat must be butchered properly before transporting to village, and [hunters must] clean butchery area. Meat will be contained in boxes or bags when shipped by plane. Hunters will use high powered rifles. All caribou must be brought into the village. 

<p>
Residents of Arctic Village report that prescriptions about butchering in the field and the 'cleaning' of the kill site by covering it with fresh snow stem from beliefs about the proper treatment of caribou 'spirits'. Limits on non-residents apply to all persons who do not live in the community, and are designed to control the harvest activities of, and number of caribou taken by, persons visiting the community. Arctic Village households are limited to five caribou during one hunting trip, in the belief that this is a reasonable number to be properly butchered and transported at one time."  Although not formally codified, additional tradition rules continue to be practiced: Other rules relating to the harvest of caribou in Arctic Village pertain to prohibitions against feeding caribou meat to dogs, with the exceptions of bones, scraps, or unused meat. Furthermore, when caribou first appear near the community, customary law prescribes that the first group of caribou is to be allowed to pass by without interference. The belief is that once caribou migrate through without being killed, others will follow believing the route is safe. The failure of caribou to appear near the community during one fall in the late 1970s was attributed by local elders to a violation of this customary law by one.

SALMON

<p>
<blockquote>
The Fish
We turn our minds to the all the Fish life in the water. They were instructed to cleanse and purify the water. They also give themselves to us as food. We are grateful that we can still find pure water. So, we turn now to the Fish and send our greetings and thanks.
Now our minds are one. (Mohawk Prayer)
</blockquote>

<p>
From across the northern Pacific Rim in Alaska, Northwest America, Canada, Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island, the Indigenous People celebrate the salmon with songs, dances, myths, and legends.

<p>
According to Mahah legend, salmon were people before they were transformed into fish and, as fish they look forward to fulfilling their duty as food for earth people, part of the sacred Circle of life (Roche & McHutchison 1998, 12).

<p>
I remember the first time I saw the Salmon spawn in the Russian River on the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska.  The males, body bright red, bottom jaw jutted out, struggling to jump the rapid and the falls, the females with ragged fins, waving their tails close to the gravely bottom to create a small depression for the eggs. Their silvery skins, both males and females sloughing off, announcing imminent death. In the swift flowing waters of the Russian River, a circle of life was ending and beginning. I sat on the bank of the roaring river. Along the banks, on the gravel sandbars, delicate alpine flowers tossed their heads in the winds. Gulls squabbled over the silvery carcasses.  My heart cried for the fish in their struggle to produce their young, a struggle ancient in time and space.  For many years after that I couldn't eat salmon, even though my people are fish people from the East Coast.

CULTURAL PLANTS

<p>
<blockquote>
Now we turn to all the Medicine herbs of the world. From the beginning they were instructed to take away sickness. They are always waiting and ready to heal us. We are happy there are still among us those special few who remember how to use these plants for healing. With one mind, we send greetings and thanks to the Medicines and to the keepers of the Medicines. Now our minds are one. (Mohawk Prayer)
</blockquote>

<p>
We are all travelers on this ship we call Mother Earth.  Some of us are Christians, some Buddhists, or even atheists, but the undeniable fact is that we are all nourished by the fruits of the Mother.  In this bounty we have made discoveries and advances. We have even unleashed the awesome exploitation of the atom's properties and nuclear radiation.  The brains of such scientists are nourished by the bounties of Mother Earth.  She provides us with cereals, fruits, berries, plants, and meats.  And life here cannot extrapolate itself from the molecules of oxygen; hydrogen, calcium and carbon together constitute the elements of proteins and form the complete human being (Men 1990).

<p>
Cultural plants are plants used as medicines or in making traditional crafts.  For example, Ledum among the Inuit of Canada is made into a tea for sore throats.  The Mi'kmaq of Eastern Canada had a whole pharmacy of plants that were used as healing remedies for the people.  Some of these are: ledum, bay berry, bunchberry, yellow birch, plantain.

SPIRITUALITY
</font>

<p>
The Balance of the Medicine Wheel

<p>
The Medicine Wheel teaches that as humans we have four aspects to our nature: the physical, the mental, the emotional, and the spiritual.  Each of these aspects must be equally developed in a healthy, well-balanced individual.  To find balance and healing according to the natural order, we must seek the center of the Medicine Wheel where all aspects are in balance.  

<br>
<br>

<p>
THE CIRCLE 

<p>
When Native people pray, we form a circle. When we dance, we dance in a circle to honor our Creator in celebration. Mother Earth is round, the trees are round, our wigwams are round. Each day has a cycle. Grandmother Moon circles her daughter, the Earth and controls the rise and fall of the great salt waters. We use her as a time mechanism. As she controls the tides, she controls the menstrual cycles of women from whence we all came. (Noel Knockwood, B.A., Elder Spiritual Leader and Special Advisor on Native Affairs, Correctional Service Canada)

SMOKE AND SMUDGES

<p>
Indian tribes in North America believe that smoke carries our prayers skyward to the Creator. The sacred plants, which are burned in the ceremony, are local to the ecosystem where the tribe lives.  For example, Indian tribes in the Northwest burn small bundles of cedar leaves tied with ribbons.  In the Plains cultures, sweet grass which is found on the prairies and fashioned into a braid, is burned.  The smell of the smoke is sweet and strengthens the spirit.

<p>
In our culture, smoke is a part of our spirituality, much like incense and candles are part of other religions.  Many American Indian people smoke cigarettes.  To them it is part of the culture and not seen as unhealthy.  Sometimes, if you look really carefully, you can see the old men make the subtle shape of the four directions with their cigarette. 

<p>
Other sacred plants that can be used for smudging are: sage, birch bark, juniper.
