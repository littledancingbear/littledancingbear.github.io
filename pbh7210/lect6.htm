<p>
As Indigenous peoples world wide, the land is so much a part of who we are and of our lifeways. The land and the culture are interconnected and maintain our way of life. When the land is compromised or when our culture is not valued by the dominant society, of course we have poor health.  We have seen this over and over in again in the United States, in Australia, in Canada and in other countries whose colonizing governments devalued the land, the culture and the lifeways of Indigenous people.

<p>
Our traditional lands are the links to our ancestors and to the future of the next seven generations to come.  Whenever we do anything, we think about the effect that it will have on the land and on future generations.

<p>
For the next few minutes, let me discus some of the case studies where traditional lands, in Australia, Indian Reservations in the US, and First Nations reserves in Canada affected by ecological contamination caused health problems exhibited in depression, low self esteem, and other socio-biological changes for Indigenous people. 

<p>
As a First Nation's woman whose family roots are spread over the Maritime provinces of Canada, I cannot speak for the Aboriginal people of Australia, but I understand their history, and I understand the similar paths we have traveled with colonization. I speak for those who think as I do. Throughout Australia's history, mining, colonialism and a devaluing of the land and the culture of the Aboriginal are causing great gaps in the health of Aboriginal Australians. 

<p>
I need not retell the story of Australia's invasion by the British, and the racism that still exists.  But I can tell you similar stories from Canada, and from the US and you make the correlation for yourself.  For example: 

<p>
<font size="+1">
Northern Quebec, Canada
</font>

<p>
I begin in Canada with the Cree in Northern Quebec: In 1971 Hydro Quebec, the provider of electricity throughout the province of Quebec, stole the traditional hunting and fishing grounds from the Cree.

<p>
The project, called the Great Whale Project, was to dams all of the rivers that flow into James Bay.  The dams would be used for hydro electricity to supply power as far as New York City.  In Phase I, four dams were built on the Eastmain, the La Grande, and the Caniapisceau Rivers.  The water behind the dams flooded 50% of traditional fishing and hunting territories. Caribou, the principle food for the Cree, no longer able to migrate into the area, found other wintering grounds.  But in the first year that the dams were completed,  the caribou had no knowledge of the flooded lands and hundreds of thousands died as they attempted to cross the river on their traditional migration route.  In a few years, bacteria from the flooded vegetation gave off methymercury; fish ate the contaminated plants.  The people ate the fish and many succumbed to mercury poisoning in the form of Minimata disease.  Non Indian people came in and ran the dams.  The province of Quebec gave the nomadic Indian people houses to live in.  Brought into the settlement of Chisasibi with the whites, the Indian people developed signs of psychosocial distress exhibited in poor self-esteem, spousal and substance abuse, suicides, and inhalation of solvents.

<p>
The symptoms of Minimata disease initially were thought to be from alcohol abuse and smoking.  No one thought to check into the ecological contamination of the fish.

<br>

In The Arctic
</font>

<p>
Since the 1950s or just after World War II, 60,000 new synthetic chemicals have been introduced into the environment.  Many of these chemicals use chlorine as a base.  Organochlorine herbicides and pesticides for example. Another group of chemicals is the polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs.  These are used as lubricants, solvents and although they have not been manufactured in the States since the 1970s, these chemicals are persistent in our environment and affect human health.

<p>
The Arctic is a great heat sink into which these chemicals flow from the southern atmosphere.  They are airborne and arrive on wind currents and are deposited on the land, snow and waters of arctic ecosystems. These chemicals have entered the food chain and reside in the fat tissues of mammals, insects, plants, fish, and birds.  

<p>
Svalbard lies 1200 miles north of Oslo, Norway.  Based on polar bear studies, researchers have found that this population of isolated polar bears is highly contaminated with chemicals including PCBs, DDT and other persistent Organo chemicals. Some polar bears have a PCB level of 90ppm.  The tolerable level or standards for foods fit for human consumption is 1ppm. In that same area harp seals are known to carry a PCB level of 70ppm.

<p>
PCB contamination is also affecting the breast milk of Inuit women who have been tested at 14.7ppm.  Babies to Indigenous women in Arctic Quebec have seven times more PCBs than children born in southern Canada.

<p>
Falk et. al (1992) found that women with breast cancer have higher levels of organochlorines in their breast tissues and other fatty tissues than women without breast cancer.  In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where PCBs have been dumped since the 1950s from GM and organochlorines are used in the paper bleaching process, the Beluga whale population has demonstrated an increase in mammary cancers.  In fact, when these animals wash up on shore they are treated like toxic waste so contaminated are their bodies.

<p>
On the Mohawk Indian Reserve bordering the St. Lawrence River between the USA and Canada, turtles examined by the tribe's environmental resource scientists have been found with a PCB level of 800ppm.  Mohawk women have a high rate of breast cancer.

<p>
Research from the World Health Organization demonstrates that industrialized countries have far more cancers those countries with little industry. WHO has concluded that 80% of cancers is attributable to environmental influence (Steingraber 1997, 60).

<p>
In 1964 two scientists with the National Cancer Institute, US, stated "The unfolding cancer epidemic is fueled by … increasing contamination of the human environment with chemical and physical carcinogens and with chemical that support the action of these chemicals."  Their words fell on deaf ears (Steingraber 1997).

<p>
Persistent organochlorines are currently under examination by researchers such as Theo Coburn for their endocrine disruption and estrogenic micmcry in the reproductive health of animals and humans.

<p>
If theories presume that breast cancers are caused by an increase exposure to estrogen through early menarche and late menopause as the data suggests, we are being flooded with estrogen in the form of these estrogen mimics and synthetic chemicals.  For example, Dr Soto a well-known breast cancer researcher from Tufts University in Waltham was researching h effects of estrogen on breast cells.  Her cells in the petri dishes grew without the addition of estrogen. Thinking that the sample was contaminated she made new samples and the same thing happened.  Their lab traced the estrogen to the plastic petri dishes and the leaching out of nonly phenol into the samples.  What does that say for the plastics in our lives?  When Israel banned PCBs and organochlorines from their country, the breast cancer rate declined 30%.

<p>
In addition to the endocrine disrupting chemicals, nuclear fallout and waste from uranium mining affects the health of Indian people in a more insidious way.  In Point Hope Alaska, our wise federal government allowed contaminated soil from nuclear waste fallout in Nevada to be buried near an Inuit village.  It went unmarked for 30 years.  Hunters hunted near it and caribou migrated through it.  The people wondered why they had such a high cancer incidence 578 per 100,000.  

<p>
Public Health studies related it to the incidence of smoking.  Finally in 1997, Dr. Bowerman, Chief Medical Officer from the Borough of Barrow, Alaska published his findings that this was indeed the result of the nuclear waste buried near the town. 

<p>
Contamination by radioneuclides from nuclear fallout in above ground testing also affects the health of the Arctic people. The tundra lichens take up strontium 90 and Cesium.  Through the lichen-caribou-human food chain, a direct correlation exists between the levels of strontium and cesium in caribou feeding on tundra lichens in the winter, and the levels of strontium and cesium in the bodies of Inuit people of the tundra.

<p>
In addition to the introduction of endocrine disrupters into the environment, mining, especially uranium mining and effects from nuclear fallout is taking a terrible toll on the lands and health of the world's Indigenous people.  Uranium mining, has caused, and continues to cause, environmental, social and spiritual disruptions in the lives of our people.

<p>
The female breast is one of the organs most susceptible to radiation carcinogenesis. (according to the National Research Council 1980).  Direct absorption of radionucleides is the most intense process in which fallout occurs in arctic tundra ecosystems with lichens being particularly susceptible to contamination.  Radioactive contamination in the Polar Regions comes from a number of sources one of which is nuclear fallout, the other is uranium mining (Colomeda 1996).

<br>

<p>
<font size="+1">
The Navajo Reservation, USA
</font>

<p>
The Navajo mines closed in 1970.  Thirty years after mining began, of the 150 Navajo men who worked in the mine, 133 died of radiation-induced lung cancer or had severe lung and respiratory disorders such as fibrosis.  As their fathers continued to die of lung cancer, children played in the waters that flowed through abandon mines and tailings piles.  The children developed burning skin sores (Grinde & Johanson 1996).   

<p>
Because of the radioactive contaminated waters, birth defects and Down's syndrome, previously unknown among the Navajo, soared (Weaver 1996). Of all infant deaths in the Navajo IHS service unit for the years 1990-1992, 35.0% were caused by congenital anomalies (USDHHS, Indian Health Service 1995, 40).  Mortality attributed to malignant neoplasms age adjusted rate is 78.5% for the Navajo IHS service unit in the years of 1990-1992 (USDHSS, Indian Health Service 1995, 65).  

<p>
A 1976 Environmental Protection Agency report found radioactive contamination of drinking water on the Navajo Reservation in the Grants, New Mexico area near a uranium mining and milling facility (Eichstaedt 1994, 208). 

<p>
The working conditions [in the mines] were terrible.  Inspectors looked at the vents.  When they weren't inspected, they were left alone. Sometimes the machines [for ventilation] didn't work. They told the miners to go in there and get the ore shortly after the explosions when the smoke was thick and the timbers were not in place.  There was always the danger of the ceiling falling in on them (Eichstaedt 1994, 173). 

<p>
The water [from the drilling hose] was leaking from the drilling into a pop can wedged under the water hose. [The leaking hoses provided a source of drinking water]	I drank that a lot of times.  It was fresh and cold (Eichstaedt 1994, 189).

<p>
At Moonlight Mine they used to work with their bare hands and shoveled the uranium into a bucket and hauled it up...no coveralls...no showers.  They worked you like a slave. They wanted the miners to work twenty to twenty four hours a day (Eichstaedt 1994, 188).

<p>
Not only did exposure to uranium cause health problems in the miners themselves, uranium continues to create health hazards for Navajo families.  There are twenty-two homes in the Red Valley area and several dozen more across the reservation  constructed from mine tailings or radioactive rocks.  Because uranium bearing sandstone fractures easily into squares and provides a readily available source of construction materials.   With the help of federal assistance, the tribe has replaced seventeen of the homes in Red Valley. 

<p>
When the mines finally closed, millions of tons of tailings were abandon by processing companies and have been blowing in the wind since the 1960s.  The tailings contain thorium-230 and radium-226  which are doomed to leach into the ground water for over 1000 years (Eichstaedt 1994.)  

<p>
In a situation that occurred in 1979,  94 million gallons of water contaminated with uranium mining waste broke through a United Nuclear Corporation storage dam. The water poured into the Puerco River in New Mexico, the main water supply for the Navajo Indians that live along the river, and a tributary of the major source of water for Los Angeles.  Navajo ranchers, their children, and farm animals waded through the river unaware of the radioactive danger.  This tragedy continues to take toll on the health of Navajo people, who lost the use of their water.  To the Navajo, this event is also a prophetic warning for all humanity (Keane 1997).

<p>
In New Mexico, roads to the Laguna Pueblo were resurfaced with low-grade uranium ore.  Similar material was used to construct the tribal buildings and housing.  Birth defects soared as they did in the case of the Navajo.  In 1995, the Indian Health Service unit serving Indian people in the Phoenix area listed 27.9% of infant deaths were caused by congenital anomalies (Indian Health Service 1995, 41).  The age adjusted mortality rate for malignant neoplasms in the IHS service unit in Phoenix was 76.9% (Indian Health Service 1995, 65).

<p>
In the State of Washington near tribal lands, the Hanford nuclear plant released more than 440 billion gallons of irradiated water thirty miles upstream from the Yakima Reservation between 1945 and 1989 ... oysters caught at the mouth of the Columbia River were so toxic that when one Hanford employee ate them and returned to work the following day, he set off the plant's radiation alarm (Weaver 1996, 49).

<p>
In Tennessee, the Nashville IHS service unit serves Indian people from Oklahoma, home of General Atomic's Sequoyah Fuels uranium processing facility which was closed in 1992.  In its 21 years, it was cited for more than 15,000 violations of federal and state laws. Native Americans for a Clean Environment (NACE) was instrumental in its closing (ien@igc.apc.org). In the Nashville IHS Service area, 32.3% of all infant deaths were due to congenital anomalies in 1991-1992.

<p>
It is highly likely that the congenital anomalies problems that we experience in these three IHS service units are from genetic mutations from radioactivity from closed uranium mines.  

<p>
As Indian people we continue to experience many health problems as a result of the collisions of our culture with the dominant euro-centric culture.
