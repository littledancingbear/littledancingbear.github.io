<blockquote>
In 1971, Aboriginal people knew that they faced severe health problems and had minimal access to mainstream medical care.  The solution to these problems, to set up an independent community - controlled medical service, was an entirely Aboriginal concept.  It was neither instigated nor supported by any section of government nor health bureaucracy. Patricia Fagan, Aboriginal Medical Services, Redfern, N.S.W.  (cited in Reid & Trompf 1991)

Introduction
</font>

<p>
The advent of alternate strategies and methodology to address the poor status of Indigenous health in Australia has arisen from Indigenous community recognition of the need to be proactive within the parameters of health services and their delivery.

<p>
In Indigenous communities, there existed many barriers to both the client and the service provider for a full, cooperative and satisfactory health consultation. These barriers, which in fact establish preconditions for access, consumption and delivery, resulted in levels of dissatisfaction for both the client and the service provider.  This dissatisfaction more often than not has resulted in the perpetuation of ill - health for the Indigenous consumer.

Indigenous Community Health: A Model
</font>

<p>
Given the inability of mainstream health infrastructure to satisfy the health needs of Indigenous Australians and their communities, is there a model for health professionals that will assist them to address issues of ill health within the Indigenous domain?

<ul type=disc>
