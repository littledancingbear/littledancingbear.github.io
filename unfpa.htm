<font size="+1">Introduction</font>

<p>
On 20 October 1998, Dr. Nafis Sadik,  Executive Director of the United Nations Population 
Fund (UNFPA), issued a press release in which she stated:

<blockquote>
UNFPA deeply regrets today's news that the United States will not include funding for 
UNFPA in appropriations for the coming financial year. The decision penalizes not only 
UNFPA but the millions of ordinary women and men on whose behalf we work. It will inevitably 
reduce our ability to implement vital programmes in the area of reproductive health and 
rights. 
</blockquote>

<p>
What had happened? Why did the USA wish to "penalize" millions of women in countries far 
away from God's Own Country? And why did they attack UNFPA for US $20 million, which is 
the sum they contribute to the programs of this UN agency? Global politics in practice? 

<p>
We tend to believe that the world is becoming a "global village", as if the diversity of 
Mother Earth could be pressed into such a small device of human societies. It reminds me 
on the phrase of "we are all sitting in the same boat", and I always respond: "perhaps, but 
who gives the commands?"

<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="+1">The United Nations</font>

<p>
International politics has always been a favorite topic of national debates, particularly 
when powerful groups do not want to discuss domestic issues. Foreign aid is another topic 
of the same quality. In most political debates on international relations, the public is 
not informed about (a) the scale of the financial involvement of its respective country, 
and (b) the political frame of reference for international politics in a world, which 
continuously becomes globalized not only as regards financial markets, but each and every 
detail of everyday life of the citizens in their respective countries.

<p>
In a press release by the staff organization of UN in September 1996 it was stated:

<blockquote>
The budget for the UN's core functions -- the Secretariat operations in New York, Geneva, 
Nairobi, Vienna and five Regional Commissions -- is $1.3 billion a year. This is about 4 
per cent of New York City's annual budget -- and nearly a billion dollars less than the 
yearly cost of Tokyo's Fire Department. It is $3.7 billion less than the annual budget of 
New York's State University system.

<p>
The USA's share of the UN's regular budget is $321 million a year -- the equivalent of 
$1.24 per American.
</blockquote>

<p>
You may not believe it, but the United Nations are not an expensive, luxurious agency. As 
a matter of fact, given the enormous program of work, it is a rather inexpensive agency 
compared to others. 

<p>
The member states of the United Nations subscribe to the by-laws of the organization, which 
defines rights and duties alike. The guiding principle is: one nation, one vote. This 
principle is not implemented to the fullest extent as the permanent members of the Security 
Council of the UN have a veto-right when it comes to essential questions of peace-keeping. 
To a certain degree, the permanent members, i.e. China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and 
USA, can determine what the United Nations will adopt as their policies simply by using 
their veto-power.

<p>
This right, however, does not apply to the technical UN organizations like the World Health 
Organization or the United Nations Populations Fund. In these organizations, all of the 
member states have to agree upon the program of work and other matters. 

<p>
Neither UN Headquarters nor the technical agencies are organizations to which member states 
donate money without getting anything back. The UN relies strongly on the work of 
consultants, i.e. experts from member states who provide input into respective programs. 
Staff of the UN and its agencies is hired from member states according to the percentage 
of membership dues in regard to the budget of the organization. Australia, the United 
Kingdom and the USA have more staff employed by the UN than their quota permits them. The 
simple reason: the UN is mainly working in English and with the English system of bureaucratic 
procedures. Citizens of the said countries have an advantage against, say, Japanese or 
Chinese citizens.

<p>
A closer look at the day-to-day operations of the UN will reveal that the influence of the 
English culture is far greater than many expect it to be. In other words, there is hardly 
any reason for these countries to complain of inequalities or even disadvantages as their 
political and technical preferences are concerned.

<br>

<font size="+1">The UNFPA case</font>

<p>
I have provided a bit more detail about the background of the UN in order to be able to 
analyze the UNFPA case more precisely. It is with surprise to note that the United Nations 
Population Fund has come under such hostile scrutiny by the USA. 

<p>
UNFPA has a proven record of good practice, probably much more so than other UN agencies:

<blockquote>
UNFPA-supported programmes have succeeded in raising the use of family planning and reducing 
reliance on abortion. All UNFPA programmes are based on the principle that individuals have 
the right to make their own decisions in regard to the size and spacing of the family and to 
the means and information to do so. UNFPA reproductive health programmes do not promote 
abortion nor provide assistance for abortion services. 

<p>
Falling birth and population growth rates in developing countries demonstrate beyond question 
the practical validity of promoting reproductive health and rights as ends in themselves, as 
well as the means to achieve smaller families and slower population growth (20 October 1998 
UNFPA press release).
</blockquote>

<p>
Reproductive health means: empowerment of women. It refers to diminish inequalities between 
women and men and it operates under the priority to give women (back) control over their 
health. This does not seem to be an attractive perspective for the US-Government. One can 
only speculate why, and I leave it open to the reader to find her own conclusion. 

<p>
Women's health has always been a controversial issue with UN agencies. UNFPA is only the last 
case in a series of interventions by powerful countries into the program of work of these 
agencies. It is well-known, for example, that the World Health Organization has been put under 
enormous pressure for decades as regards reproductive health. This pressure has been 
organized by mainly Catholic countries which reject the idea of artificial contraception and 
family planning. An interesting document in this regard is available on the Internet at: 
<a href="http://www.kzpg.com/Lib/Pages/Books/NSSM-200/">
http://www.kzpg.com/Lib/Pages/Books/NSSM-200/</a>. It provides access to documents on the 
influence of the Holy Sea on WHO's family planning program and gives insight into global 
power politics.

<p>
We need to be aware that not one aspect of UN agencies' programs of work is a-political. 
Public health and development are too often seen in terms of charitable enterprises, when 
in reality they refer to matters of global power-structures, economies and the prevalence 
of certain ideologies. Unfortunately, we tend to view matters concerning Mother Earth in 
fairly egotistical, i.e. national categories when we should know that they are international 
in essence. This is not only a problem with the USA, but relates to other so-called developed 
countries as well.

<p>
National governments pretend that contributions to international organizations are lost 
monies. They do not state that up to 95% of the contributions to foreign aid projects 
worldwide flow back to the donor countries in terms of consultants' fees, products which 
need to be bought in donor countries and maintenance services. Foreign aid provides employment 
in donor countries, it constitutes hidden subsidies to the domestic economy, which is one of 
the reasons why we see so many unsustainable development projects. The recipient countries 
simply cannot afford to maintain the facilities often provided by the so-called developed 
countries.

<p>
Reproductive health is an example, which does not consume much in terms of sophisticated 
technology, but refers more importantly to the social development of the population in 
countries active in this domain. Social development goes hand in hand with education. And 
education always relates to degrees of enlightenment. Perhaps it is this particular aspect 
of reproductive health, which donor countries like the USA do not appreciate at all. 

<p>
Taking a look at the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, one of the key documents each 
UN member state has to sign and ratify before becoming a regular member of the UN, it becomes 
clear that education, equality, and enlightenment are seen as key topics of good governance. 
No member state can claim to act according to the Human Rights Declaration when it obstructs 
programs of reproductive health which precisely aim at improving the living conditions of 
millions of women and subsequently their children. The UNFPA case demonstrates that the USA 
violate the Human Rights Declaration of the United Nations.

<p>
Coming back to the UNFPA case, it is clear that the decision to withdraw funds from its 
program of work will have serious effects. According to the press release of Dr. Nafis Sadik 
from 20 October 1998, UNFPA estimates the effects as follows:

<blockquote>
In one year alone, the impact of the United States' decision to withdraw funding from UNFPA 
will be to deprive 870,000 women of effective modern contraception. Over 520,000 will end up 
not using any method. Non-use and use of ineffective methods will result in:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1,200 maternal and 22,500 infant deaths; 
<li>
15,000 life-threatening illnesses and injuries to mothers during pregnancy and childbirth. 
<li>
500,000 unwanted pregnancies, resulting in: 
<li>
234,000 unwanted births; 
<li>
200,000 abortions. 
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wonder whether President Clinton, his advisers, and the interest groups behind the decision 
of the US Government are willing to accept the responsibility for the losses of life and the 
harm their decision will bring to countries far away from the posh environments of Washington 
DC.
