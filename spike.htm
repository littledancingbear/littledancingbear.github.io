no jacket, no,

never that

<P>
totalization of

feelings of love

and worry

the melancholic 
<BR>
a mediatory mediator

totally mediocre

with the back to the wall

<P>
having learnt to laugh

and having stolen the wisdom

of the moon,

selling the witch a

vacuum cleaner,

<I>siemens</I>, of course

<P>
the cliffs of dover:
<BR>
never having seen them, 
<BR>
but sometimes, at the bar, 
<BR>
strategically placed 
<BR>
with comrades of a 
<BR>
similar mind

<P>
simply: 
<BR>
wenzel

<P>
verbal adventures: the

possibility of discovering

new continents 
<BR>
no more just countries;

but

<P>
continents, 
<BR>
continents upon continents

<P>
declaring war 
<BR>
upon matters of detail 
<BR>
visionaries have been called up,

dreamers, the mad and others

implanting thermometers

<P>
loves a discussion, but,

when loosing the thread 
<BR>
adapting croquet as 
<BR>
a proclamation of 
<BR>
the principles of existence

<P>
sometimes cold hearted 
<BR>
always childish 
<BR>
seldom calculating

<P>
to discover the depth 
<BR>
of the feminine soul 
<BR>
without using a breathing apparatus, 
<BR>
releasing lagunes into the open sea 
<BR>
and to discuss the reasons of one's 
<BR>
existence with the mountains 
<BR>
who have never answered 
<BR>
a short, erotic distance 
<BR>
from the fencers rapier

<P>
always lending the philosopher 
<BR>
an ear 
<BR>
but blowing raspberries at 
<BR>
the bureaucrats

<P>
sometimes, at dusk, 
<BR>
there is self-made fear 
<BR>
for supper 
<BR>
but afterwards, around midnight, 
<BR>
the mind takes to the wing 
<BR>
and glides over the oceans 
<BR>
of time: a time never to be realised

<P>
my god wenzel
<BR>
such strength in your own name 
<BR>
a person of christian faith 
<BR>
and so strong

<P>
weak 
<BR>
piggish 
<BR>
a scholar

<P>
using the power of fantasy 
<BR>
to overcome tiredness, 
<BR>
when on the balcony of success, 
<BR>
always retaining the right 
<BR>
for a withdrawal if necessary

<P>
flying into the sun 
<BR>
never having heard of 
<BR>
fear 
<BR>
but to fly onwards 
<BR>
into a world of uncertainty 
<BR>
and now:

<P>
to tempt the golf balls 
<BR>
to fly by swinging the 
<BR>
clubs in a moderated 
<BR>
application of minimum physical effort

<P>
soft 
<BR>
a man of the world 
<BR>
insane

<P>
simply: 
<BR>
wenzel

<P>
irreplacable 
<BR>
insatiable 
<BR>
insane

<P>
simply: 
<BR>
wenzel

<P>
sometimes 
<BR>
feeling apart 
<BR>
but never &quot;<I>abartig</I>&quot; 

<P>
defining the simple 
<BR>
with a 
<BR>
knowledge 
<BR>
of worlds 
<BR>
tutorial?

<P>
no, never a teacher 
<BR>
but always absorbing 
<BR>
and, 
<BR>
having understood the name 
<BR>
of his talk-show partner, 
<BR>
to retell, relay 
<BR>
and with respect repeat 
<BR>
in the manner of 
<BR>
the simplest of the 
<BR>
simple:

<P>
simply: 
<BR>
wenzel

<P>
a modern day buddha 
<BR>
with a heart of gold 
<BR>
forbidden to atheists 
<BR>
but available to all

<P>
always sitting still 
<BR>
continuosly moving around 
<BR>
a carousel of life 
<BR>
sometimes &quot;on&quot;, 
<BR>
sometimes &quot;off&quot;, 
<BR>
but forever apparent

<FONT SIZE=+3><FONT COLOR="#FF9900"><I>My love</I></FONT></FONT>

<P>
I thought I'd meet Jesus 
<BR>
when I entered The Philippines 
<BR>
I walked through the nightmares of hope 
<BR>
and cancelled appointments with the dentist 
<BR>
of my dreams

<P>
I wore no armour 
<BR>
I had no gun 
<BR>
my mother had told me 
<BR>
I'd rather go blind 
<BR>
than looking into their eyes

<P>
Monday morning 
<BR>
I took the lessons 
<BR>
my jealousy went bankrupt 
<BR>
and my pride sailed somewhere

<P>
I asked Mary-Ann for the way 
<BR>
to the basket of hope 
<BR>
she smiled her smile 
<BR>
and directed me to the future of love

<P>
my testines revolted 
<BR>
and my skin turned into craters 
<BR>
of desperation

<P>
Mother 
<BR>
I asked 
<BR>
what is the meaning of life

<P>
she laughed

<P>
her teeth 
<BR>
covered the ignorance of last year's prediction

<P>
I came down to my feet 
<BR>
I was hoping for revelation 
<BR>
I was stupid

<P>
Mother - I do not ask for the meaning of life anymore

<P>
I just tremble because of my thoughts 
<BR>
and meaning lies in the pregnancy of 
<BR>
powerlessness

<P>
sometimes 
<BR>
I wonder through the alleys of my needs 
<BR>
the trees have lost their leaves 
<BR>
and the beast in me 
<BR>
is forgotten and buried in 
<BR>
the caves of permeating lust

<P>
I love you 
<BR>
I said

<P>
but my words 
<BR>
got lost 
<BR>
in the chips 
<BR>
that take care 
<BR>
of her 
<BR>
hearing advice

<P>
my love simmers 
<BR>
and her ears 
<BR>
listen to someone 
<BR>
who has 
<BR>
more power 
<BR>
than me

<P>
my love 
<BR>
my precious love 
<BR>
my love

<P>
I was washed 
<BR>
to the beaches 
<BR>
of your eyes

<P>
the winter sun 
<BR>
wrapped you 
<BR>
around my nerves

<P>
I tried to walk the sidewalk 
<BR>
my feet did not respond 
<BR>
I gave up

<P>
I am here 
<BR>
lingering 
<BR>
around my 
<BR>
fears

<P>
and simultaneously 
<BR>
enjoying 
<BR>
the 
<BR>
feelings 
<BR>
of love

<P>
penetrating 
<BR>
my skin

<P>
Stevie Wonder sang 
<BR>
I was made to love her

<P>
my question is simple:

<P>
why was I made 
<BR>
to love you?

While the rose

the orchid flowers
<P>
for the disciples of life

Gimme the torch.

<P>
Loving is the ultimate disease
<BR>
I get captured by my emotions
<BR>
run like a kangeroo through the night-hours of the day
<BR>
and get busted like any other criminal
<BR>
by the mind-police

<P>
Hours later
<BR>
when the sun rises
<BR>
I feel the pleasure of Nirvana
<BR>
not the rock-band
<BR>
but equally rocking

<P>
My body dissolves under warm water
<BR>
and my mind concentrates on concrete

<P>
This is 
<BR>
what they
<BR>
want us
<BR>
to be

<FONT SIZE=+3><FONT COLOR="#FF9900"><I>Sweet cries</I></FONT></FONT>

<P>
Your sweet cries
<BR>
travel through my mind
<BR>
and let me fly again
<BR>
to the sun

<P>
It's hot up here
<BR>
but I'm not afraid of dying
<BR>
because you hold me
<BR>
oh so tight

<P>
The geranium spreads its wings
<BR>
over my body 
<BR>
and the candle light
<BR>
shows me the way to the paradise of your scent

<P>
The warmth of your sweet cries
<BR>
cautiously touches my soul
<BR>
in the middle of the night
<BR>
I find myself in tears

<P>
lores are lac's life
<br>
and her life is a lore
<br>
of rising to the sun
<br>
and not leaving
<br>
her sisters and brothers
<br>
behind in the darkness
<br>
of zero-lore

<p>
that's lac
<br>
living in 
<br>
fourteen generations
<br>
her way

<p>
when the Creator calls
<br>
she's there to report:

<p>
Creator, I talked to the water
<br>
I nurtured the flowers
<br>
I prayed for the salmon
<br>
I cherished the plants
<br>
I loved the wolf
