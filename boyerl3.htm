<P>Diana Gribble: </P>

<P><I>Welcome to the 1995 Boyer Lectures series. I'm Diana Gribble.</I>
</P>

<P><I>On behalf of the ABC Board, it's my pleasure to introduce this year's
Boyer lecturer, well known activist and social commentator, Eva Cox.</I>
</P>

<P><I>Today you'll hear the third in a series of six lectures, which Eva
has titled A TRULY CIVIL SOCIETY, and in which she argues for a radical
re-thinking of our concept of citizenship.</I> </P>

<P><I>In the second lecture Eva discussed the concept of social capital,
the social glue which binds us together as a society.</I> </P>

<P><I>Today in her lecture titled 'The Dark Side of the Warm Inner Glow',
Eva Cox looks at the tribalism that can break down social capital.</I>

<H2><B>The dark side of the warm inner glow: family and communitarians</B>
</H2>

<P>Eva Cox: </P>

<P>Last week I outlined why we needed to store social capital and needed
opportunities to increase its production. Social capital is the sum of
our social connections and the levels of trust we need to maintain a civil
society. We hear a lot about financial, physical and human capital but
until now little about the base of social capital on which economic growth
depends. We need to draw on social capital for co-operative and mutually
satisfying interactions. Even conservative commentators such as Francis
Fukuyama agree that without this store of trust called social capital,
wealth creation is a real problem. </P>

<P>So there's little debate about the need for social capital development
from a wide range of political views, but considerable differences about
how we achieve growth. The merchants of simple solutions are at it again.
They claim if we want a truly civil society, rich in social capital, all
we need to do is increase the morality in communities and the power of
families, and Eureka! The problem is solved. </P>

<P>Social capital is often produced in voluntary associations, so their
false conclusion is often that government and legislation destroy social
capital. Conservative social commentators have therefore developed similar
concerns to some radical ones. They too can see there are serious problems
with a political framework built on the assumption that people are primarily
self-interested. </P>

<P>Unlike the neo-liberals, conservatives do believe that order and control
create civil societies and unfettered freedoms create chaos. </P>

<P>Some conservative writers are calling for a return to a mythical past
of local community and family independence. They see the imposition of
norms and values as the necessary social control over self-interested individuals,
but these conservatives misread the origins of social capital. </P>

<P>The danger in promoting simple solutions is that people warm to the
fuzzy words of community and family without acknowledging their darker
side. So I want to look at how we can misuse belonging to groups and the
many problems faced by the ever smaller and more vulnerable families. </P>

<P>I want to look at some of the contradictions involved in separating
society into smaller units. How we can extend the problems of competing
individual self-interest to group competition and conflict. Communities
or families can operate to create isolation and outgroups if they are not
part of a broader society. </P>

<P>There are widespread assumptions that communities and families automatically
enrich society by providing models of 'good' relationships and civic virtues.
So we should understand how such structures can either enhance or deplete
social capital by incorporating certain types of civic cultures and norms.
</P>

<P>The effects of changes in social structures over the last century and
those we can already see coming, affect both what we can do now and what
we can do in the future, as neither community nor family is a static institution.
</P>

<P>Trust, mutuality and reciprocity are the basic components of a truly
civil society. They are some of the nuts and bolts, or maybe in less masculine
terms, the social threads which make and pattern the social fabric. Tearing
the social fabric is a common metaphor used to express dark images of chaos
and disorder. </P>

<P>Creating social cohesion has a bad and good side. The good side recognises
the firm links of communality among people and extends a welcome to the
new and the different. Participants in open and inclusive communities learn
about their common attributes through positive contact. The bad side creates
cohesion by evoking perceived threats from outsiders - that is, the Other.
The good side produces a store of social trust rather than antipathy and
distrust of outsiders. </P>

<P>There have always been debates about community, what it is and how we
identify with it, but there are signs of a new communitarian movement in
the USA and UK. The concept of community appeared briefly at a recent Queensland
election. And we can expect it to surface at the national level. So, I
want to clarify how community is used in political debates. </P>

<P>In the public policy sphere, there are problems created by the frequent
assumption that identity is stable, that is, we belong to one community
and identify ourselves with that sole identifier. </P>

<P>People are assumed to belong to various social movements and therefore
have expectations thrust upon them. We acquire attributed views consonant
with our presumed political affiliation, religion, ethnicity, green, feminist
or locality based identity. This is a misreading of the way many of us
shift identities. </P>

<P>We carry links of various depths and intensities with multiple communities.
Some links may involve formal meetings and activities; others may be brief
encounters, even phone contacts to organise car pools. My research on the
use of telephones identified the threads of community links. Some are a
single thread, some are intertwined like ropes. </P>

<P>These threads tie us to a multitude of other people and create the web
that is society. Some are friendships and informal, others are very formal
and minimise the personal. Some can be measured and identified and come
to light as part of civil society, others remain part of the undergrowth.
These multiple threads create rich sources of relationships and add to
our sense of who we are and who we might be. </P>

<P>Our multiple links create, at best, robust societies where people can
see themselves through the eyes of many others. We recognise our communalities
in the diversity of humanity. Membership of multiple communities breeds
civic confidence and civic virtue and provides a basis for trust of strangers,
enabling us to work together to create social capital. </P>

<P>If groups make rejection of multiple identity a condition of membership,
then the result can be closure or even intercommunal violence. Such groups
can vary in size range from the millions that make up a nation to small
sects or even the family unit. </P>

<P>People who fear the Other, the different, seek out those whom they can
define as like themselves - 'people like us' who seem familiar and therefore
safe. This familiarity may be based on shared race, class, religion or
other clearly definable characteristics. It enables the frightened to join
others to protect a 'way of life', to save beliefs from the threat of the
unbeliever, or from the parvenu who does not really belong. </P>

<P>Family and intimate social relationships may limit our world view if
they fail to offer us contact with strangers. Recognising that many other
people are indeed familiar to us often eludes those who have only a few
close relationships and no others. Focussing exclusively on intimate relationships
denies us the benefits of broader less intense collaboration. </P>

<P>Robert Putnam, the American political scientist whose work has informed
much of my thinking, claims the development of trust, translated into social
capital, works best in relatively superficial relationships. This is because
civic relationships are essentially formed in public view through task
oriented, friendly, co-operative activities. </P>

<P>Putnam's work confirms my view that deep and intimate relationships,
often experienced within families, may not equip us with adequate skills
in sociability. We need early experiences of less visceral but more collegial
contacts such as group activities with other children and adults to help
us to learn to trust those outside our intimate circles. </P>

<P>Is the Family the smallest democracy, as was claimed in the International
Year of the Family slogan? Is there something inherently needy in modern
families? Families should be hooked into the broader community, or even
multiple communities, to avoid the problems of power and abuse on the one
hand, and loneliness and limitations on the other. There are obviously
a squillion forms of family relationships and these range from the very
good to the very bad. My comments on families will relate to public images
and policy expectations only. </P>

<P>The family that once was, is no more! Instead we have the word and warm,
fuzzy feelings. Yet there are inappropriate expectations that these small,
fragile units can deliver a wide range of services through their limited
personal resources. </P>

<P>Some families can provide good experiences.. Many offer love and nurture
but others may damage us for life. Often it is in families that we learn
about power and hierarchy, and, sometimes, violence and fear. The more
private and disconnected families are, the more difficult it is to identify
signs of abuse, or even inadequate levels of care.We need families to continue
as the first level of custodianship of the child. But rearing children
into socially competent adults requires more skills and resources than
most families can offer. Parenthood is often seen as the rights of parents
to choose what they want for their child, as if they owned them. This view
is different from a concept of custodianship where parents or carers are
presumed to be responsible to the broader community for the welfare of
the child, as in Aboriginal customary law.If trust and mutuality are learned
responses, we must have the opportunity to learn them. Few parents on their
own have the capacity to train their children in sociability, particularly
if they have not learned these skills themselves. </P>

<P>Experiencing other adults and children from a relatively early age in
dependable and quality child care settings may need to be part of all normal
child rearing. It is already possible that we are producing under-socialised
children who are less likely to have the social skills needed for good
trust relationships. </P>

<P>We should create a culture of child rearing which expects children to
be aware of the needs of others, to be co-operative and able to work in
groups. This form of child rearing does not mean children lose their ability
to think and act as autonomous individuals. </P>

<P>The idea of universal child care services runs against the supposedly
'intuitive' sense that children are better off with their mothers. However
this is a relatively recent 'tradition' with few mothers fifty years ago,
ever being alone with one or two children. </P>

<P>Of course, there are mothers who want to experience child bearing and
rearing as a continuous ecstatic experience. The question is whether this
close 'bonding' creates a competent adult who can operate in a truly civil
society. I suspect over bonding is more likely to create more self interested
individuals in search of personal gratification. </P>

<P>So our experiences in families need to be linked to our experiences
in the broader community. And these communities must open outwards and
not restrict differing views and viewpoints. Isolation and limited social
contact is a good recipe for the loss of social capital </P>

<P>Communities which reduce social capital share certain characteristics.
They turn inwards, form cliques, resist change and exclude those who criticise.
The structures of such groups are usually top down, though the power may
be informally held. Too often, allocation of rewards is based on patronage
- on favours exchanged, factions and block votes. This encourages compliance
and distrust of anyone outside the in-group. </P>

<P>These communities may include organisations such as local groups, elite
clubs, professional associations, political factions, and fundamentalist
groups, religious or otherwise. They do not build social capital because
they fail to allow members to develop voluntaristic, egalitarian relationships
through which social trust and civic virtues can be acquired. </P>

<P>Yet it is interesting to note that these are just the types of organisations
most often touted by conservatives as their model of community. They are
authoritarian in structure, seeking to impose views, laws and sanctions.
This is their way of creating a more moral community by enforcing so-called
traditional family values and calling on the past to justify their present.
</P>

<P>Here I want introduce the idea of an expanding social system, which
I will be continue in the next lecture when I look at the roles of Government.
Imagine a spiral in which each circle unfolds into wider circles. This
is a metaphor for a society which expands into ever broader social circles
so all can be part of the whole. </P>

<P>When I was a child we filled in book labels with our names and addresses
which included the continent, the world and the universe. I grew up in
a time when we talked about cosmopolitan futures, about forms of internationalism
which we hoped would replace the nationalism we saw as causing the Second
World War. Yet this approach is now lost in a welter of cries for self
determination and Balkanisation. </P>

<P>This is the darker side of community: the way groups use the processes
of belonging to create outgroups and conflict. Nationalism, tribalism and
racism are used to invoke an Other who is a threat. These movements may
be reactions to the uncertainties of globalised economies because unemployment,
falling living standards and insecurities leave many people seeking familiar
groups to belong to because they no longer feel part of the broader community.
</P>

<P>For some communitarians, the loss of power of central governments is
seen as a sign of a new beginning. Control can be returned to local people,
and we can live face to face in some post-industrial feudal state. For
others, with a techno bent, the advent of the Internet creates possibilities
for virtual communities where face to face contact is not as necessary.
</P>

<P>Communitarianism is likely to create more inequalities as the 'haves'
seek to contain their resources rather than share them. There is also the
problem of how to maintain an overall sense of belonging. Some groups will
become increasingly isolated and others will defend their territory. </P>

<P>Communitarianism therefore may only be a shift from competition between
individuals to competition between groups. Rather than living up to the
rhetoric of inclusive communities, the new communitarians seem likely to
practice selectivity. </P>

<P>Belonging is not always a plus, particularly when the gain of one is
a loss for another. There are obvious costs when diversity is introduced
to a homogeneous group. Therefore many communities, if they have the power,
choose to select only those they see as fitting in. This always leaves
some people outside as unwelcome remainders. </P>

<P>Robert Putnam comments on the dangers of sentimentalising the past and
the village. He points out that there is more civil society and social
capital in cities like Bologna than in the villages of Southern Italy.
He notes that even today, in the USA, there is less overt racism, and more
tolerance than in the so called heyday of flourishing civic societies,
whose membership was limited to white Christians. </P>

<P>These days, there are many walled and gated communities built with the
intention of excluding those who do not have the desirable characteristics.
These affluent ghettos may well be self-supporting, but they contribute
nothing towards those areas which have fewer resources. In the United States,
where local taxes pay for many public services, the well off can fund their
own schools and police, but they take no responsibility for others. </P>

<P>The new communitarian movements in the USA come from a long tradition
of self reliance and individualism. At their best, they offer a place of
safety for those deemed to be good citizens, who can pay their way with
money, skills or labour. This is, however, the same social culture that
breeds urban gangs and militias in the hills. These groups feel that they
too are grabbing their share of the American dream and defend their right
to do so. </P>

<P>The gangs and militias are uncivil societies. We need to remember this
when the conservative right calls for less central government in favour
of self managed communities. Look at what is happening in the USA and the
UK where the philosophies of reduced Government take hold. The poor on
the fringes of society, some with jobs but still homeless, can only inhabit
the badlands where there is no power to exclude the unwanted. </P>

<P>What we can learn, we can unlearn, and that includes fear and distrust.
One of the more irritating responses one hears about communal conflict
is that it is either human nature, or so embedded in our history that there
is nothing we can do about it. The philosopher, Alasdair McIntyre says,
<I>'History is neither a prison, nor a museum, nor is it a set of materials
for self congratulation'</I>. (History of Ethics p4). </P>

<P>So, prejudice, bias and racism are all learned responses and we can
unlearn them. Social learning is a constant process. We must assume that
we need to continue to mix with others, and not only those within our existing
networks. We need to maintain the ability to make and develop new links
and trust relationships and build social capital. </P>

<P>Distrust, along with fear and suspicion of the motives of others, are
evident in communities where there are few available or created opportunities
for learning to work with others. Those unpracticed in collegiality, in
friendships or in developing relationships of trust with strangers, may
be anxious about those outside their inner circles. </P>

<P>Most academic and policy work on communities assumes a level of face
to face interaction. Telephones have offered links over distance for many
decades but with little recognition of their social function. As telephone
technology is developed to allow for more varied communication, many more
people will form and join electronic primary communities. Faxes, internet
and other modes of communication, reduce our need for face to face contacts.
</P>

<P>This shift to information based and service jobs and the network economy,
means that the separation of work and living space is no longer physically
necessary. The concept of community had its origins in pre industrial societies
where communities were both production and consumption sites. The grand
urbanisations that were a response to industry and commerce saw places
of living and work necessarily separated during the era of factory production.
But do we need to maintain the urbs or suburbs as the new electronic network
economy emerges? </P>

<P>Work places are downsizing, services are outsourced and more people
are working from home in full or in part. Hot desking, contracting out
and other arrangements which reduce attendance in the workplace, will affect
those who choose to go to work as a means of getting out of the house.
</P>

<P>I want therefore to have a brief look at the somewhat intimidating electronic
futures we are being offered. Without wanting to be a Luddite, there may
be problems with the loss of inter-personal contacts: work from home, shop
from home, talk to people on the world wide web, share information, become
part of wired communities where town meetings are held from home. This
opens up a world of possibilities but reduces the necessity for face to
face relationships. </P>

<P>Drawing on my own personal experience, I can see the advantages of working
at home. There are fewer interruptions, more time to concentrate, and more
contact with others at your convenience and choice. It is surprising, however,
to notice how self centred we can become. Leaving the house becomes a major
exercise and the sharing of resources like copiers, bathrooms and even
ideas becomes much more problematic. </P>

<P>We miss out on the informal affirmations of self: the salutations, the
gossip, the small conversations and the ideas that slide out of brief chats.
Even the Silicon Valley techies have indicated that their best work is
collaborative and in person, despite their comfort with technology. </P>

<P>The more we work alone, the less practice we have in dealing with others,
and accommodating differing demands. The less time we spend in organisations,
the more we lose our management skills. If we fail to practice our social
skills, will they remain or will contact become an anxiety producing ordeal?
Are we breeding a society of agora-phobes? </P>

<P>If we extrapolate on the effects of isolation which may arise from more
home based paid work, we may find that this could affect the store of social
capital, as I have defined it. Increasing options for working at home,
and therefore the ability to combine child rearing and family care with
paid work, may well reduce our social networks as well as our work contacts.
</P>

<P>Working from home means there may be less need for work-related child
care. This begs the question of the social needs of children. And with
fewer opportunities for shopping and other excursions, people may reduce
some of their informal face-to-face networks. Are there ways in which we
can use electronic networking to create social capital? There are, for
instance, Telecottages and Telecafes where those working in distance mode
can gather at a central point. </P>

<P>The question is also whether we will make the deliberate effort to meet
with friends and colleagues, or will we just depend on accident or other-purpose
meetings to provide us with social interractions? If such meetings fail
to happen, will we gradually lose the skills of sociability? Will we then
also lose the recognition of our commonalities and become more fearful
of the stranger? </P>

<P>What we need to establish is whether we can connect these new ways of
net-working and living with the possibilities of generating social capital,
civil society and further involvement in public life. </P>

<P>So we need communities but not those which exclude. This raises the
issue of how society fits the various elements together, spiralling upwards
into ever widening circles. </P>

<P>So, next week I will look at the vexed issue of the roles of government
in generating social capital. </P>
