<p><br>What
happens to the hole when the cheese is gone?
<br>Bertolt
Brecht (1898-1956)&nbsp;
<p>War
is like love; it always finds a way.
<br>Bertolt
Brecht (1898-1956)&nbsp;
<p>Today
every invention is received with a cry of triumph which soon turns into
a cry of fear.
<br>Bertolt
Brecht (1898-1956)&nbsp;
<p>What
is the crime of robbing a bank compared with the crime of founding one.
<br>Bertolt
Brecht (1898-1956)&nbsp;
<p>He
who laughs last has not yet heard the bad news.
<br>Bertolt
Brecht (1898-1956)&nbsp;
<p>Poverty
makes you sad as well as wise.
<br>Bertolt
Brecht (1898-1956)&nbsp;
<p>The
miracle is not to fly in the air, or to walk on the water, but to walk
on the earth.
<br>Chinese
proverb&nbsp;
<p>Love
your neighbors, but don't pull down the fence.
<br>Chinese
proverb.&nbsp;
<p>A
human being should be able to heal a wound, plan an expedition, order from
a French menu, climb a mountain face, enjoy a ballet, balance accounts,
roll a kayak, embolden a friend, tell a joke, laugh at himself, cooperate,
act alone, sing a children's song, solve equations, throw a dog a stick,
pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, love heartily, fight
efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
<br>Lew
Hitchner&nbsp;
<p>For
every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.
<br>H.
L. Mencken&nbsp;
<p>Perhaps
in time the so-called Dark Ages will be thought of as including our own.&nbsp;
<br>G.C.
Lichtenberg&nbsp;
<p>I
get my exercise running to the funerals of my friends who exercise.
<br>Barry
Gray&nbsp;
<p>I
dread success. To have succeeded is to have finished one's business on
earth, like the male spider, who is killed by the female the moment he
has succeeded in his courtship. I like a state of continual becoming, with
a goal in front and not behind.
<br>George
Bernard Shaw&nbsp;
<p>Be
careful of reading health books, you might die of a misprint.
<br>Mark
Twain&nbsp;
<p>Don't
go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing.
It was here first.
<br>Mark
Twain&nbsp;
<p>It
is by the fortune of God that, in this country, we have three benefits:
freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either.&nbsp;
<br>Mark
Twain&nbsp;
<p>Whenever
you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to reform.&nbsp;
<br>Mark
Twain&nbsp;
<p>Research
is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing.
<br>Wernher
von Braun&nbsp;
<p>I
believe I have found the link between animals and civilized man. It is
us.&nbsp;
<br>Konrad
Lorenz&nbsp;
<p>When
all actions are mathematically calculated, they also take on a stupid quality.&nbsp;
<br>Theodor
W. Adorno&nbsp;
<p>Life
without risk would be like chilli without heat - edible but bland.
<br>Gary
Egger, Ross Spark &amp; Jim Lawson&nbsp;
<p>The
risk climate of modernity is thus unsettling for everyone: no one escapes.&nbsp;
<br>Anthony
Giddens&nbsp;
<p>Life
is short, science is long; opportunity is elusive, experiment is dangerous,
judgement is difficult.&nbsp;
<br>Hippocrates&nbsp;
<p>A
wise man thinks it more advantageous not to join the battle than to win.
<br>La
Rochefoucauld&nbsp;
<p>There
is more to life than increasing it's speed.
<br>Mahathma
Ghandi&nbsp;
<p>In
fact, safety has no place anywhere. Everything that's fun in life is dangerous.
Horse races, for instance, are very dangerous. But attempt to design a
safe horse and the result is a cow (an appalling animal to watch at the
trotters.) And everything that isn't fun is dangerous too. It is impossible
to be alive and safe.&nbsp;
<br>P.J.
O'Rourke&nbsp;
<p>Moderation
is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess.
<br>Oscar
Wilde&nbsp;
<p>Life
has become the ideology of its own absence.
<br>Theodor
W. Adorno&nbsp;
<p>Life
has changed into a timeless succession of shocks, interspaced with empty,
paralysed intervals.
<br>Theodor
W. Adorno&nbsp;
<p>All
you have to do is relax and feel your history, because it will never go
away and there is no future without it.
<br>Raymond
Douglas Davies&nbsp;
<p>If
you're patient and you wait long enough, something will usually happen
and it'll usually be something you don't like.
<br>Kinky
Friedman&nbsp;
<p>I
think there is a world market for maybe five computers.
<br>Thomas
Watson, chairman of IBM, 1958&nbsp;
<p>Fishing
... is a sport invented by insects and you are the bait.&nbsp;
<br>P.J.
O'Rourke&nbsp;
<p>The
Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work and then gets
elected and proves it.
<br>P.J.
O'Rourke&nbsp;
<p>On
Friday, June 12, 1992, 110 heads of state gathered at Riocentro. They were
indistinguishable in dress and deportment. Where was biodiversity when
we needed it?&nbsp;
<br>P.J.
O'Rourke&nbsp;
<p>It's
not the 'nice' guy who brings about real social change. 'Nice' guys look
nice because they're conforming. It's the 'bad' guys, who only look nice
a hundred years later, that are the real Dynamic force in social evolution.
<br>Robert
M. Pirsig&nbsp;
<p>A
man who says that men are machines may be a great scientist. A man who
says he is a machine is 'depersonalized' in psychiatric jargon.
<br>Ronald
D. Laing&nbsp;
<p>Because
we have put ourselves in our own zoo, we find it difficult to break out.
<br>Edward
T. Hall&nbsp;
<p>As
far as Germany extends, it ruins culture.
<br>Friedrich
Wilhelm Nietzsche&nbsp;
<p>Self-worth
and financial worth become indistinguishable.
<br>Peter
Russell&nbsp;
<p>I
spent most of my time thinking, because I didn't have enough energy to
do anything else.
<br>Banana
Yoshimoto&nbsp;
<p>Liberals
like people with their heads, radicals like people with both their heads
and their hearts.
<br>Saul
D. Alinsky&nbsp;
<p>The
only nonpartisan people are those who are dead.
<br>Saul
D. Alinsky&nbsp;
<p>Our
world has always had two kinds of changers, the social changers and the
money changers.
<br>Saul
D. Alinsky&nbsp;
<p>Neither
love nor terror makes one blind: indifference makes one blind.&nbsp;
<br>James
Baldwin&nbsp;
<p>If
all you want to do is make money, the very last thing you need is imagination.&nbsp;
<br>James
Baldwin&nbsp;
<p>Creative
thought must always contain a random component.
<br>Gregory
Bateson&nbsp;
<p>Information
consists of differences that make a difference.
<br>Gregory
Bateson&nbsp;
<p>Science
probes; it does not prove.
<br>Gregory
Bateson&nbsp;
<p>Those
who lack all idea that it is possible to be wrong can learn nothing except
know-how.
<br>Gregory
Bateson&nbsp;
<p>In
the nature of the case, an explorer can never know what he is exploring
until it has been explored.
<br>Gregory
Bateson&nbsp;
<p>If
the expenditure of money for entertainment in America is any indication
of taste, clearly the majority of us are addicted to trash.&nbsp;
<br>Marlon
Brando&nbsp;
<p>When
time grows short, self-serving wins out over others-serving.
<br>Lee
Burns&nbsp;
<p>I
don't believe in heroism; I know it's easy and I've learned it can be murderous.
What interests me is living and dying for what one loves.&nbsp;
<br>Albert
Camus&nbsp;
<p>Pity
is easy, but it is difficult to care.
<br>Raymond
Douglas Davies&nbsp;
<p>Institutions
have the pathetic megalomania of the computer whose whole vision of the
world is its own program.
<br>Mary
Douglas&nbsp;
<p>Social
evolution may be the result of intention, but it rarely, if ever, produces
the result intended.
<br>Rene
Dubos&nbsp;
<p>In
man, at least, satisfaction is commonly followed by boredom.
<br>Rene
Dubos&nbsp;
<p>One
may wonder indeed whether the pretense of superior health is not itself
rapidly becoming a mental aberration.
<br>Rene
Dubos&nbsp;
<p>You
are always born under the wrong sign, and to live in this world properly
you have to rewrite your own horoscope day by day.
<br>Umberto
Eco&nbsp;
<p>Fools
are in great demand, especially on social occasions. They embarrass everyone
but provide material for conversation. In their positive form, they become
diplomats.
<br>Umberto
Eco&nbsp;
<p>Our
agenda, by necessity, is as complex and encompassing as the problems we
face: beware of politicians promising simple solutions.
<br>Amitai
Etzioni&nbsp;
<p>The
same men who are blind and deaf to feminism are acutely sensitive to what
threatens their dominance and privilege.
<br>Marilyn
French&nbsp;
<p>The
view of life as a struggle for power generates a language in which life
has no significance and only power matters.
<br>Marilyn
French&nbsp;
<p>In
six days the Lord created the heavens and the earth and all the wonders
therein. There are some of us who feel that He might have taken just a
little more time.
<br>Kinky
Friedman&nbsp;
<p>They
say that death is just nature's way of telling you to slow down a little
bit.
<br>Kinky
Friedman&nbsp;
<p>Golf
is the only opportunity that middle-aged WASPs have to dress up like a
pimp.&nbsp;
<br>Kinky
Friedman&nbsp;
<p>Now
I have a cat. Well, that's not quite accurate. A cat and I have each other.&nbsp;
<br>Kinky
Friedman&nbsp;
<p>People
know elections, like television commercials, are not real.
<br>William
Greider&nbsp;
<p>If
everyone has to be a watchdog in order to make government work, then the
foxes will also volunteer to serve.
<br>William
Greider&nbsp;
<p>The
problem of modern democracy is rooted in its neglect of unorganized people.
<br>William
Greider&nbsp;
<p>It
is better to be full of drink than full of food.
<br>Hippocrates&nbsp;
<p>In
life, man proposes, God disposes.
<br>Aldous
Huxley&nbsp;
<p>If
you are free, you are not predictable and you are not controllable.
<br>June
Jordan&nbsp;
<p>Sometimes
we become so sophisticated we have to read the New York Times in order
to figure out whether it's a hot or a rainy day.
<br>June
Jordan&nbsp;
<p>War
is always a professional enterprise; despair is left to amateurs.
<br>Hans
Koning&nbsp;
<p>What
we think is less than what we know; what we know is less than what we love;
what we love is so much less than what there is. And to that precise extent
we are so much less than what we are.
<br>Ronald
D. Laing&nbsp;
<p>Wilderness
is a resource which can shrink but not grow.
<br>Aldo
Leopold&nbsp;
<p>The
modern dogma is comfort at any cost.
<br>Aldo
Leopold&nbsp;
<p>To
build a road is so much simpler than to think of what the country really
needs.
<br>Aldo
Leopold&nbsp;
<p>Good
health has become a new ritual of patriotism, a market place for the public
display of secular faith in the power of will.
<br>Roger
Levin&nbsp;
<p>What
our laws show is the extent and degree to which conflict has to be suppressed.
<br>Alasdair
MacIntyre&nbsp;
<p>Truth
has been displaced as a value and replaced by psychological effectiveness.
<br>Alasdair
MacIntyre&nbsp;
<p>Modern
politics is civil war carried on by other means.
<br>Alasdair
MacIntyre&nbsp;
<p>I
can't understand why you don't get any mail from me. Perhaps it's because
I haven't been writing.
<br>Groucho
Marx&nbsp;
<p>Please
accept my resignation. I don't care to belong to any club that will have
me as a member.
<br>Groucho

<p>TV

<br>Groucho
Marx&nbsp;
<p>The
earth is a museum of divine intent.
<br>Bill
McKibben&nbsp;
<p>We
have assumed control where once we worked with what we were given.
<br>Bill
McKibben&nbsp;
<p>Our
weird problem is an abundance of resources and a shortage of hard economic
reasons not to use them.

<br>John

<br>George
Orwell&nbsp;
<p>Time

<br>Thomas
Paine&nbsp;
<p>Individuals
would never have a chance acting alone; only organized people could balance
organized money.
<br>Mary
Beth Rogers&nbsp;
<p>Of
course, everyone wants to be healthy. The amusing thing is no one's really
sure how to do it.
<br>Jerry
Seinfeld&nbsp;
<p>The
rich are very charitable: they understand that they have to pay ransom
for their riches.
<br>Bernard
Shaw&nbsp;
<p>Individuals
control their behavior in order to control the behavior of others.
<br>Paul
Sites&nbsp;
<p>And

they think I should do.

answers seldom do explain.
<br>Patrick

suddenly.
<br>Oscar
Wilde&nbsp;
<p>To
love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.
<br>Oscar
Wilde&nbsp;
<p>Questions
are never indiscreet. Answers sometimes are.

<p>The
only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has

B. Conant (1893-1978)&nbsp;
<p>Nothing
is more useful than silence.
<br>Menander
(B.C. 342-291)&nbsp;
<p>The
world is full of suffering. Birth is suffering, decre- pitude is suffering,
sickness and death are sufferings. To face a man of hatred is suffering,
to be separated from a beloved one is suffering, to be vainly struggling
to satisfy one's needs is suffering. In fact, life that is not free from
desire and passion is always involved with suffering.
<br>Buddha
(B.C. 568-488)&nbsp;
<p>Show
me a thoroughly satisfied man - and I will show you a failure.

<p>Doubt,
of whatever kind, can be ended by Action alone.
<br>Carlyle
(1795-1881)&nbsp;
<p>Not
every end is a goal. The end of a melody is not its goal; however, if the
melody has not reached its end, it would also not have reached its goal.

<p>A
great obstacle to happiness is to expect too much happiness.

<p>Words

words.
