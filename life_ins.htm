<li>
Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great
risk. 

<p>
<li>
When you lose, don't lose the lesson. 

<p>
<li>
Follow the three Rs:
Respect for self; Respect for others; and Responsibility for all your
actions. 

<p>
<li>
Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a
wonderful stroke of  luck. 

<p>
<li>
Learn the rules so you know how to break
them properly. 

<p>
<li>
Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship. 

<p>
<li>
When you realise you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it. 

<p>
<li>
Spend some time alone every day. 

<p>
<li>
Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values. 

<p>
<li>
Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer. 

<p>
<li>
Live a good, honourable life. Then when you get older and think back, you'll  be able to enjoy it a second time. 

<p>
<li>
A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life. Do all you can to create a tranquil, harmonious home. 

<p>
<li>
In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation. Don't bring up the past. 

<p>
<li>
Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve immortality. 

<p>
<li>
Be gentle with the earth. 

<p>
<li>
Once a year, go someplace you've never been before. 

<p>
<li>
Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other. 

<p>
<li>
Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it. 

<p>
<li>
Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.
