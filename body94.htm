<p>This piece of work reflects my theoretical interest in the concept of
body and time. There is no other interest in this paper than the pleasure
to think, to speculate, to assume or to suppose whatever comes to mind
in the given context. This is not what reviewers call a &quot;scientific
paper&quot; because I am trying to explore something of which I do not
yet know what it is all about. The paper contains subjective, sometimes
even personal thoughts. </p>

<p>1. </p>

<p><i>Forever young</i>, was the paradoxical, but perfectly appropriate
message sent out by Bob Dylan at the end of the 60s. He meant it in a common
sense way, he did not think about techniques of the prolongation of life,
cosmetical surgery or the negation of biological processes. He simply mirrored
what he saw in his environments. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of <i>The
Rolling Stones</i> will be 51 years of age in 1994 and on a world tour
promoting their latest album <i>Voodoo Lounge</i>; although Jagger said
in the 60s, he could not imagine singing <i>Satisfaction</i> after the
age of 50, he is still up there, alive, well and kicking. Keith Richards
is even wilder; he simply lives the rock &amp; roll life as he has done
for the past 30 years; medics would call him a drug addict, others name
him one of the best rock &amp; roll guitarists of the world. </p>

<p>Paul McCartney of <i>The Beatles</i> will be 52 years of age by the
end of 1994. He lives together with his wife and kids on a farm in the
northern parts of England; he has become a vegetarian and environmentalist
donating parts of his shows and income to environmentalists' causes. He
is still pursuing his pop-music career. He never doubts that his music
has brought pleasure to hundreds of millions of people. And there is certainly
no doubt about it. </p>

<p>US-President Bill Clinton is the first national leader of a developed
country being younger than those being charged for the <i>rock revolution</i>
of the 60s. He will be 48 years of age by the end of 1994. Well, he was
born in the town called Hope. No kidding. </p>

<p>Have we entered an era of time- and culture-related confusion? </p>

<p>2. </p>

<p><i>The Rolling Stones'</i> <i>I can't get no satisfaction</i> was not
just a rock song and has never been, but has become the hymn of affluent
societies of the northern hemisphere because it reflects the unrealizable
need for <i>MORE</i>. More of health, more of sex, more of pleasure, more
of speed, more of sunshine - in short: more of everything is good and less
of everything is bad. </p>

<p>The good are young, healthy, professionally successful and extremely
mobile with regard to everything. The bad are relatively poor, narrow-minded
and certainly not mobile. Who wants to be narrow-minded? Who wants to be
poor? Who wants to be immobile? We are told that humans are flexible in
almost any aspect of their existence, particular as far as their body is
concerned. Is fashion not a good example for this flexibility? </p>

<p>In the age of <i>The Rolling Stones</i>, organ transplantations, cosmetic
surgery, and all kinds of body-building have become ordinary events. The
living body has become subject of repair- and style-shops - gender-distinguished,
expertise-based and pseudo-rationally used. We bring our body to the market-place
and look what we can do for it to enhance its quality and value regarding
social interaction and psycho-physical investments in social relations.
</p>

<p>3. </p>

<p><i>Our body, ourselves</i> has become a desperately inadequate formula.
Neither have we had &quot;our&quot; body, nor have we been &quot;ourselves&quot;.
Have we been ourselves at all? Or have we not always been the self of others,
too? Have we not learned we are socialized people, only partly responsible
of what we have become, however almost always made responsible for what
we do? Do we not explain to each other our background, and do we not want
to know the background of the other person before we make further decisions
whether we want to continue relations? </p>

<p>Some may say we have never been ourselves at all because we belong to
an universe of living beings. We live in a global eco-system, interconnected
with billions of other beings, depending upon numerous sub-systems. We
are certainly not alone. The cats, for example, are not here in my house
because I decided so on my own; they have had their active involvement,
too. The domestication of beings is not a one-way street (Budiansky 1992).
The same is true regarding our ways in dealing with other relations and
therefore with our body. </p>

<p>Artificial insemination and gentherapy are only the latest techniques
to intervene in the body. We assume that we are able to set aside biology
and replace it with man-made technology. This is not just a spin-off of
science or technology. This is rather the intended outcome of publicly
and privately funded research aiming at the discovery of new areas of potential
and profitable businesses. When all kinds of gadgets are available in the
market to ease our daily life, business needs to look for some new areas
to penetrate. In societies of great affluence, the body presents the ultimate
area of intervention. </p>

<p><i>We are witnessing nothing less than a commercial invasion into our
blood, organs, and fetuses, our gametes and children, our genes and cells.
As body parts and materials are sold and patented, manipulated and engineered,
we also are seeing an unprecedented change in many of our most basic social
and legal definitions. Traditional understandings of life, birth, disease,
death, mother, father, and person begin to waver and then fall (Kimbrell
1993, 228).</i> </p>

<p>When basic needs are satisfied, needs of different kinds will be defined,
felt and nurtured. Humans have never been without needs. If people have
not defined their needs themselves, they have been defined by those in
power; consequently they offer opportunities to realize these &quot;needs&quot;.
This is what Kimbrell's book <i>The human body shop</i> is all about. </p>

<p>4. </p>

<p>The human potential is realized, so it seems, in its performance and
in the manipulation of it. We are what we perform, respectively performed
for. That sounds strange only at first glance. We are not aware of what
is done to our body because we are not aware of our body in the first place;
we do not use it, it is used and we go along with it. Even if we are involved,
we tend to perform according to the model of rational action, i.e. we tend
to adjust our performance to what we think is reasonable rather than to
what we feel emotionally satisfactory. There are so many cases during the
day in which we do things although we do not like them to do. And there
are several other occasions in which we do things even so we do not realize
why we are doing them; we perform habitualized behavior. </p>

<p>As humans, we seem to need the feeling of timelessness particularly
when we are in need of time for ourselves. Timelessness makes us feel strong.
It gives us the impression that we own past, presence and future. We tend
to imagine that only lack of time is preventing us from doing the things
we <i>want</i> to do. Of course, this impression is wrong. Time is too
abstract a concept that it would be able to interfere in our daily routines.
Societal rules and regulations impinged on us serve as monitors of our
performance in a much stronger way than time will ever be able to do. </p>

<p>On the other side, time is the concept permitting us to organize our
days along its compartmentalized segments. Because of its representation
of structure, time seems to be a matter of rhythm. This certainly is true
as far as individual circumstances are concerned. Ironically, time is a
structural means in this respect, while it becomes functional as far as
societies is concerned. </p>

<p>While time is rhythmic, society follows melodies. Social systems
fashion themselves daily because of the changes in their internal and external
relations, i.e. in their functions rather than in their structures. Revolution
and reform are concepts terrorizing social systems because they call for
a change of melodies (functions) and probably also for a change of rhythm
(structures). Perhaps, they call for changes when social systems have felt
well and at ease for a longer period of time. </p>

<p>No, that is not true. Social systems do not feel anything. They present
a concept agglomerating social interaction under specific circumstances.
They represent even more: they have become the buzzword for excuse, accusation
and blame. As human beings, we tend to attribute to social systems qualities
being substantial only for our existence. We also tend to attribute to
them those qualities which we are ashamed and/or afraid of attributing
to ourselves. We love to blame because blaming gives us a break in coming
to terms with ourselves. Coming to terms with ourselves - is that the purpose
of life; is that what we are occupied with in the course of time? </p>

<p>5. </p>

<p>We never really think about time - we only think about appointments.
We love to structure our lives along an appointment calendar. We do not
wish to think about the chronology of life. This would be a far too abstract
concept when we are enjoying life. We do not dare to think about the future
because the future is uncontrollable. Future is a wild ocean of time. It
rejects our approaches of rational management. We may dream about the future,
about sailing this ocean, but we do not seriously deal with the future
in a constructive way. The only time when future becomes an issue of daily
life is the day when we sign an insurance policy. </p>

<p>We treat our life as a commodity (Burns 1993). We seem to believe that
monetary investment results in biological outcomes; think about body-building,
jogging or any other physical activity currently being promoted as fashionable
and/or health-promotive. The investment in genetechnology, for example,
reflects our wish to stay alive as long as we can. We do not even recognize
that genetechnology, i.e. the combination of biological research and economics,
combines different spheres, put into the same format of thought by us:
we tend to think in terms of market-economy, although there is probably
no such economy anywhere in the world, and we think of longevity, although
we know that there is no such perfect cure that would give us what we want.
But we have internalized the thoughts of this model, i.e. that everything
may become a commodity in the market place. In other words, the human body
in particular, and life in general have become commodities, so it seems:
</p>

<p><i>... we are now in the early stages of adding the human body, its
parts and processes, to the list of commodities that are subject to the
laws of supply, demand, and price. The body is not a commodity. It is not
a manufactured product intended for consumption. However, just as the new
techniques in industrial technology led to the commodification of noncommodities
such as human work and nature, the new techniques in biotechnology, including
transplantation, reproductive technology, and genetic engineering, are
now leading to the commodification of the body (Kimbrell 1993, 272-293)</i><br>
</p>

<p>It seems we want to stay alive as long as possible because we are afraid
of losing something. Death has become the ultimate threat to wealth, irrespective
of how much we own because it will always be much more than the other people
in the southern hemisphere have access to. We fear death because we fear
the loss of commodities and persons supposedly belonging to us. Our collective
existence seems to be connected to the defeat of death. At least for human
beings in developed countries, life has always had this character. As self-styled
conscious beings, we are probably aware of the end of our individual life
in some point of time and simultaneously we may know that our collective
life will continue. The latter thought supposes that we have an idea of
spiritual domains intervening in our lives. It supposes that there are
spiritual qualities and dimensions of our life irrespective of our own
rationale. </p>

<p>However, as we have lost our spirituality due to the acceptance of the
paradigm of rationality, we are now fighting for the spiritual dimension
of life with rationality, i.e. with the specific rationality that guides
us through bureaucratic formulas, departmental regulations and helps us
to obey traffic signs. We do not realize, so it seems, that rationality
on the level of philosophical discourse does not necessarily result in
rationality on the level of social action. Thought and action have always
been distinguished - not only in philosophical terms, but specially in
terms of action. We do not understand that spirituality is not an issue
to be fought for rationally in order to get it back into one's life. Spirituality
is a matter of time, furthermore, it is a matter of body, mind and soul
in the context of time. </p>

<p>6. </p>

<p>When I was in Germany in the summer of '94, I had a hard time because
after unification, the Germans have become enemies of themselves. The body
politics have gone back to the fifties and early sixties. People mistrust
each other in unexpected ways. The differences between West and East are
no more easily detectable in terms of economics or urban planning but in
the opinions that people voice. There is dissatisfaction all over. The
reason, again, is time. They have been promised to be as wealthy as their
Western &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; within three to, at least, five
years. Of course, that did not happen. It has been a specific information
policy helping the government staying in power thereby neglecting all survey
data pointing to a much more difficult time integrating East Germany into
West Germany and <i>vice versa</i>. </p>

<p>While we have better insight, we seem to have worse action. The other
way around: the more information we have, the less we trust our senses
and subsequently our bodies. In difficult times we tend to become periodically
bodiless. Although we (bodily) know that there is no existence without
bodily struggle, we enhance our minds to take over control. <i>Mind over
matters</i>, sang <i>Dire Straits</i>. Mark Knopfler, the mastermind behind
this group, clearly spoke out what was going on in northern societies.
Fundamentalists of southern and northern countries have picked up the issue
without hesitation. They defined the body a timeless one. If you sacrifice
it, you will be honored in this and the other world. Time has become eternal
time, ironically in both worlds. </p>

<p>While the northern countries are on the path to technological reproduction
of the body, the southern ones are about to sacrifice the body to superior
forces. The body has become a nothing, at least a nothing concerning societal,
cultural and political fora; it is only something to be manipulated. Or
maybe it is the other way around: the body has become everything. It is
treated like a commodity, even though the term commodity does not apply
to the body: </p>

<p><i>The body is not a commodity. It is not a manufactured product intended
for consumption. However, just as the new techniques in industrial technology
led to the commodification of noncommodities such as human work and nature,
the new techniques in biotechnology, including transplantation, reproductive
technology, and genetic engineering are now leading to the commodification
of the body (Kimbrell 1993, 272-273).</i> </p>

<p>The body has been secularized to the degree that it has become an object
of different technologies. Perhaps humans are seen as commodities providing
storage of organs, health and disease thereby giving a lot of people employment.
Diseases are determined via checks similar as in the case of automobiles.
In the latter case the check is determined by the amount of kilometers
or miles the car has passed; in the former case it is years of age and/or
gender and/or occupation defining the criteria for regular check-ups. The
body is increasingly seen as a machine, as Kimbrell (1993, 249) states:
</p>

<p><i>Our association of the body with &quot;efficient machines&quot; has
crept into our culture in ways other than work. It has created a modern
body type in the machine's image - what one commentator has called &quot;techno-body&quot;.
The techno-body ideal, for men, and increasingly for women, is the &quot;lean,
mean machine&quot;: a hairless, overly muscled body, occasionally oiled,
which very much resembles a machine. For many body zealots, the healthy
body is one that functions and looks like an &quot;efficient machine&quot;,
not a body that is functioning in a natural and holistic fashion. </i><br>
</p>

<p>7. </p>

<p>Why have we gone so far and putting mind over matter (i.e. body)? Why
do we conceive of the body as a machine? How much are we afraid of the
body? How much are we sure of mind? Do we really believe that there is
just matter and mind? No spirituality? No religion, beliefs, superstitions?
Do we believe we would be more rational than our ancestors, and if yes,
why can we hold to that belief? </p>

<p>There are no simple answers to these questions. I do not have answers
resolving the questions. I do know there has been some time when our thoughts
were redesigned towards what we now call <i>reason</i> or <i>rationality</i>.
It is the era of enlightenment, back in the 17th century. Descartes and
later on Galilei, Locke, Newton, Kant and Humboldt among others substantiated
the idea of mind over matter, or of reason over material. This type of
philosophy has survived until today. It has become the major philosophy
of developed countries. Rationality, they say, is the essence of the state,
of the government, of organizations. </p>

<p>Others may describe and label our mainstream philosophy differently.
I go along with the critical remarks made by Amitai Etzioni (1988, 15):
</p>

<p><i>individuals are found to be much more limited in their ability to
reason than is often suggested; typically, we shall see, they are sub-rational
at best.</i> </p>

<p>Of course, this is not a scientific statement but one which is loaded
with insight. There is more critical insight in the development of industrialized
countries and their subsequent degradation of mind to a psychological commodity.
Michel Foucault and J&uuml;rgen Habermas have been brilliant examinators
in this respect; they found that the concept of society does not bear the
kind of consensus being suggested by conservative politicians. They demonstrated
that reason was just another whore of those in power. They have not, however,
enlightened us about ways and means how to overcome the irrationality of
this type of &quot;rational culture&quot;. </p>

<p>The de-reasoning in a culture of rationality is extremely ironic. While
emphasis is put on functionality, the rationality of its subjects is almost
neglected. All of the latest technological &quot;break-throughs&quot; are
more related to the increase of functions and less to reason, let alone
the enhancement of individual and collective living conditions. Our belief
system has been shaped towards the calculable and manageable. It is probably
Ronald Reagan who represents this approach to the ultimate extent. <i>Star
Wars</i> is the perfect concept in relation to what our minds have become;
we are on the outlook for ultimate control. Reagan and his advisers thought,
control of each and everything on earth and in the galaxies would result
in security. They never understood total security would result in death
because total security presents the state of entropy in which nothing is
happening at all because no risks are taken any more (Rifkin 1985). </p>

<p>Living beings need risks to exercise their potential for surviving.
The concept of security which aims at &quot;total security&quot; or at
total prevention of any hazards is actually denying some of the basic facts
of life. As someone so eloquently stated: </p>

<p><i>Life without risk would be like chili without heat - edible but bland
(Egger, Spark &amp; Lawson 1990, 17).</i><br>
</p>

<p>I would even go one step further and state that this kind of chili is
not chili anymore. It is something else. </p>

<p>8. </p>

<p>Our current understanding of risk refers to threats caused by individual
or collective action and/or its projected outcomes. In daily life, we define
risk as the probability that something negative will happen when we realize
a specific action. We are looking for safety and for secure ways of reaching
the goals we have set or that have been set for us. We believe there should
be technologically safe ways guarding us to the goals we want to attain.
If we have to select from options, we assess the risks they may contain
- either by listening to experts telling us about them or by referring
to our own understanding and common knowledge concerning the experience
others have had. </p>

<p>This understanding of risk reflects the belief that there are technically
safe solutions for fundamentally social problems. This applies particularly
with regard to health and health-related behaviors being basically social
issues. They are embedded in the cultural patterns and social settings
of any given society. The meaning of health - as well as the meaning of
life in general - is subject of a social discourse. Discourses are potentially
colliding because there may be as many different views on the subject as
there are participants in the discourse. The notion of consensus regarding
social discourse is not realistic. Perhaps there may be a consensus about
an issue for a certain, mostly short period of time. However, as life goes
on, people will again develop in different directions leading to different
perceptions of the world and the beliefs and values held by them. Thus,
there will always be dissent about issues and, ultimately, about risks
related to certain actions. </p>

<p>Some may consider an action as risky; however, to them it seems worthwhile
to take the risk. Others disagree with them. On the societal level, the
debate about risk is related to institutions and, subsequently, to the
power they have to decide which action is considered to be risky. It is
an organizational setting in which risks are assessed and the outcome of
the assessment is presented to the public in different forms as: </p>

<ul>
<li>recommendations, </li>

<li>warnings, </li>

<li>regulations, </li>

<li>laws. </li>
</ul>

<p>While recommendations are the weakest form of policy interfering in
daily life of individuals, groups, and organizations, warnings already
bear concrete threats to them, at least on the behavioral level in terms
of negative effects their behavior may result in. Regulations and laws,
finally, decide upon the correctness/incorrectness of behavior and action
and define - more or less clearly - which sanctions are to be taken if
people and/or organizations are identified of non-compliance. </p>

<p>Regulations and laws do not necessarily lead to their enforcement. As
William Greider demonstrates, environmental laws and regulations in the
USA among others have not been enforced as intended but have become subject
of <i>deal making</i>: </p>

<p><i>The high art of governing - making laws for the nation and upholding
them - has been reduced to a busy commerce in deal making. Thousands and
thousands of deals are transacted every day in diffuse corners of the city.
The rare skills required for politics at the highest level are trivialized
as petty haggling, done with the style and swagger of rug merchants (Greider
1992, 105).</i> </p>

<p>Organized special interest influences national agencies to consider
specific regulations helping to avoid the intended effects of laws related
to their interest. While laws and regulations are meant to reduce risks
concerning the public, special interest is concerned to reduce risks regarding
its business by imposing risks on the public. While risks are considered
to be negative, the risk taking has to be covered up as soon as business
and economy is involved (Bryner 1987, Reagan 1987, Landy et al. 1990).
At the same time, individual risk behavior such as smoking, drug abuse,
or excessive alcohol consumption, is blamed to be responsible for the huge
increase in health care costs. Individual action is interpreted as threat
to an institution which is held alive, for example, by the medical industrial
complex profiting from the criticized behaviors. </p>

<p>The assessment of risks is not unequivocal. It depends on interests,
beliefs, and values of the assessors. They may base their assessment on
research data; however, research data from social sciences are not unequivocal
either. Study designs, methods, and statistical analyses and concepts of
explanation may differ considerably depending on the frame of reference
and the interpretation of data. As long as these are not taken in account,
data have no value at all. Besides the technical discussion on research
reflecting the increasing importance &quot;experts&quot; play in the domain
of scientification of daily life, the feelings of people are mainly considered
as non-technical - as if one had to graduate from university to lead a
reasonable, technically sound life. Often, self-styled scientific debates
are targeted to cover up the issue rather than to enlighten the people
and the decision-makers with regard to the subject in question. </p>

<p><i>The negative connotation of the word risk creates a fundamental problem
in the notion of 'risk taking', namely differences in perception regarding
the inherent value or worth of some action or behaviour between the 'risk
taker' and the risk assessor. Risk taking implies intent on the part of
the actor, but the intentions of the action are not fully appreciated or
acknowledged with this one-sided view of risk. The risk assessor judges
the actions of another individual to be harmful (or bad?). The (real or
perceived) benefits to the individual of smoking, eating, drinking, driving,
flying, or whatever, are not considered. The health-enhancing aspects of
the benefit of some action to the individual may more than compensate for
its health-threatening aspects (rational behaviour?). The notion of risk
as wager - assessing both losses and gains - would seem a more appropriate
conception of risk in relation to 'risk taking'. Analysis of both positive
and negative aspects of behaviour would provide the 'risk taker' an opportunity
to play an active role in labelling and evaluating 'risk', thereby wresting
exclusive power to determine 'risk' away from an external 'expert' (Hayes
1992, 404).</i> </p>

<p>Risk is a concept directly linked to life; that is, it is linked to
the living conditions and lifestyles of the people. Aldous Huxley holds
human life is mostly prohibited to blossom fully due to restrictions of
the social and economic conditions: </p>

<p><i>Most men and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best
so monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to
transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been
one of the principal appetites of the soul (Huxley 1977, 50)</i> </p>

<p>Beyond the structural risks of evolution and, thus life, individuals
and groups develop behavioral patterns and strategies helping them to cope
with the requirements and contradictions inherent in their ecological and
economic living conditions. These not only involve health-promotive behaviors;
people also practice health-hazardous behaviors for different reasons.
Within the framework of the lifestyles approach (Wenzel 1983), the concept
of risk behavior has been used to reflect upon those living conditions
and social situations in which people might carry out certain behaviors
for a specific period of time which may be considered by others as health-hazardous;
however, the individuals involved may not feel the hazards being important
as long as the positive effects of the behaviors are qualified as superior,
both individually and collectively. </p>

<ul>
<li>The function of risk behaviors is to help individuals and groups manage
the difficulties and problems of daily life. It would be a misconception
to view risk behaviors <i>per se </i>as deviant behaviors. They are well-accepted
by social groups performing them irrespective of what other social groups
may think of them. Several risk behaviors are socially more or less accepted
such as drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, sun-bathing, taking pills,
having sex with multiple partners in the life course, driving fast, etc.,
while others are viewed as unacceptable by society-at-large, such as <i>train-surfing</i>
(a practice in Latin American countries where youths ride atop high speed
trains standing upright). Some are presented in the context of sports such
as freestyle mountain climbing (in the USA, the slogan is: <i>if life gets
boring, risk it</i>), deep-sea diving, high-speed skiing, high-speed motorboat
driving, bull-fighting etc.; they communicate the message that those who
carry out these sports are somewhat like heroes (at least for one day).
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The outcomes of risk behaviors are mainly relaxation, pleasure, fun,
i.e., <i>well-being for a short period of time</i>. Risk behaviors involve
only a short-term time perspective. They are always oriented towards a
specific social situation and are characterized by a desire to achieve
well-being as quickly as possible; Huxley (1977, 52) uses the term <i>frequent
chemical vacations from intolerable selfhood and repulsive surroundings</i>.
In most cases, therefore, risk behaviors are related to leisure because
in this temporal context people have more individual and collective opportunities
to decide upon what they want to do. This particular social sector has
been developed in developed countries according to commercial and industrialized
patterns. Numerous facilities offer services meeting peoples' desire to
achieve relaxation, pleasure and fun. From a sociological point of view,
one can argue there is an industry offering facilities for risk behaviors
- and it meets peoples' needs to get away from daily life for a certain
amount of time. This short-term time perspective of risk behaviors is an
important factor with regard to health promotion. Health-related behaviors
rather frequently are time-consuming and also bear some amount of uncertainty
regarding their benefits, while risk behaviors relate to alternatives offering
immediate gratification regardless of their potentially health-hazardous
effects. For example, after a day full of stress, an individual may decide
to unwind by practicing meditation, taking a nap or doing relaxation exercises,
all of which may be beneficial health-wise. However, the alternative of
visiting a bar to have a drink is often more attractive, though it might
be damaging to health depending on how much the person drinks. <i>Living
in the fast lane</i>, as a popular rock-song stated some years ago, or
living in <i>computime</i> (Rifkin 1989) does not seem to allow for long-term
considerations concerning well-being. Risk behaviors thus tend to become
an integral part of every lifestyle. The question is whether we will be
able to reduce the potentially health-hazardous effects of these behaviors.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Risk behaviors are perceived as individual and/or collective attempts
to gain control over certain situations in terms of well-being. The functionality
underlying risk behaviors does not necessarily follow rational criteria.
The term <i>control</i> is used in a subjective way, i.e., as far as the
individual perceives a situation as being under his/her control, a certain
risk behavior is considered an appropriate way to contribute to well-being.
This represents the deeply in-routed irrationality of our system of reason.
It permits to be rationally irrational. For example, taking a pill may
help one to fall asleep in a situation of constant stress; drinking several
glasses of beer may help one get away from the strains of the workplace.
By pursuing these risk behaviors, the individual pretends to control the
past and future: the past because the behavior enables him/her to escape
from a situation so that it no longer serves as a stressor; the future
because the behavior contributes to future well-being, i.e., the individual
will once again attain a position in which he/she can face reality and
to try to cope with it the next day. The problem with risk behaviors lies
in the fact that this kind of control is only of subjective relevance;
it does not affect the causes of the stress perceived nor does it contribute
to an individual and/or collective study of possibilities of overcoming
the difficulties involved in certain situations and experiences. The main
objective is just to achieve well-being irrespective of the past and future
circumstances of one's life. </li>

<p><i>Health</i> has become a fashionable word. <i>Health</i> food, <i>health</i>
club, <i>health</i> shop, you name it. While becoming a fashionable word,
it has also become a product - or, maybe the other way around? There were
products which entered the market labeled <i>health</i> products? It is
probably difficult to decide which came first. It is not important for
our argument. It is, however, important that <i>health</i> entered the
marketplace. <i>Health</i> shops sell health? It seems this is their message.
The concept behind it is, that we can buy <i>health</i> if we buy the products
from the health shop. Until recently, we have bought milk, vegetables,
meat, eggs and seafood in the supermarket around the corner; on Saturdays
we may have gone to the market and we looked for vegetables and eggs fresh
from the farmer. Now, there is the <i>health</i> shop, telling us just
by its existence that other shops do not seem to be selling healthy products.
When buying at the <i>health</i> shop, everything will be fine concerning
our individual health and the health of our families. We do not have to
worry about toxicated fruits and vegetables, chicken from the chicken industry
fed with artificial fodder, meat from animals pumped up with all kinds
of chemical fertilizers. We just go to the <i>health</i> shop, buy the
amount of <i>health</i> for us and our family - and we will be happily
healthy. Correct? Well. </p>

<p>Health has entered the market. It has become an ordinary product, sold
to ordinary people, sometimes paying not so ordinary prices for it. As
we know, however, quality has its price - and <i>health</i> is certainly
supposed to be a high quality <i>per se</i>. One thing amazes me: as there
is virtually nothing one can say against <i>health</i> because it is thought
of being <i>the</i> product making life comfortable, easy, pleasing, enjoyable,
why do we need &quot;social marketing for health&quot; as an approach to
sell the message to the people that they ought to lead <i>healthy lives</i>
- as if the people were interested to lead unhealthy lives. What is so
bad about <i>health</i> that we have to enlighten people so that they buy
<i>health</i>? Or is it so difficult to understand what <i>health</i> means?
And if so, why is it so difficult? Has <i>health</i> been covered up during
the past decades? Is it therefore, that people do not know anymore what
<i>health</i> is all about? Have they lost their senses concerning <i>health</i>?
And if so, when and why did it happen? Has <i>health</i> to be put on the
list of endangered values/products/goods because many people have exploited
their health? </p>

<p>I suppose that the public discourse about <i>health</i> reflects several
problems crucial to the development of industrialized societies: </p>

<ul>
<li>as the exploitation of natural resources has reached a degree which
already has led to the extinction of thousands of species, and which has
deforested millions of hectares of land crucial for the global climate,
and thus, for keeping an ecological balance of Planet Earth, people increasingly
become aware something might have gone wrong with industrialization; </li>

<li>as people recognized that affluent societies pay a high price for their
kind of living conditions and lifestyles, that is, as there is more and
more wealth, and much less health or: as there is more health to the wealthy
and less health to the poor, people seem to feel that inequalities of this
kind are unbearable for any society in terms of morale, values, beliefs,
and political constitution; </li>

<li>as governments and those in power have recognized that the costs of
industrialized development turn out to be unpayable in the future, i.e.
as they recognize that the predominant pattern of development seems to
destroy the basic fundaments of its existence, that is: the ecological
system and the health of people, they are forced to take action - to prevent
this pattern to be rejected by the people; they have initiated the public
discourse about health, thereby meaning any behavior of the individual
which can be considered unhealthy; strong alliances have been built having
access to mass media and other channels of communication to direct people
to living <i>healthy lives</i> - as far as the developing countries at
least is concerned: in an increasingly unhealthy environment; </li>

<li>as the &quot;solutions&quot; proposed by those in power tend to be
technical solutions to basically social problems, they will fall short
of solving the problems at all; <i>health</i> is a concept involving long-term
time perspectives, communication, social action, and involvement of people
in developing living conditions and lifestyles conducive to health; </li>

<li><i>improving health </i>needs organized people who are involved in
the pursue of common goals/goods which is almost the perfect contradiction
to what the economic term <i>market</i> means. </li>
</ul>

<p>The presentation of these problems leads to three different meanings
of <i>health</i> at least: </p>

<ul>
<li>health being a medically defined state of body, mind and soul, </li>

<li>health being related to certain types of behavior, </li>

<li>health being an inherent quality of life. </li>
</ul>

<p>The meanings are communicated in political programs and decisions, in
mass media campaigns, in health education leaflets, and of course in the
marketplace. There is no consensus about what health means; the term is
utilized for different purposes and has, thus, become part of the policy
process. Sometimes it is used to cover up political decisions aiming at
an increase of social control of individual and collective behavior; sometimes
it is used to present a vision of society in balance; sometimes it mystifies
human needs and behavior; and sometimes it is plainly used to educate people
to conform to expert's advice. </p>

<p>Marshall H. Becker (1986), the late American health educator, deals
with these difficulties in his paper <i>The tyranny of health promotion</i>
in which he states: </p>

<p><i>reasonably content people have had their fears aroused and fell compelled
to attempt significant behavioral changes, attempts at which many (if not
most) will fail; some advice is subsequently considered to have already
been harmful; and the public has become confused, and even skeptical, about
public health advice, perhaps especially because we offer our contradictory
advice sequentially (15-16) ... to turn our attention beyond the individual
- to recognize the social and economic determinants of disease, health
and &quot;wellness&quot; - is complex and threatening (19) ... the individual-responsibility
approach has helped to establish &quot;health&quot; as the New Morality
by which character and moral worth are judged. &quot;Being ill&quot; is
redefined as &quot;being guilty&quot;. The obese are stigmatized as &quot;letting
themselves go&quot;. Smokers &quot;have no will power&quot;. Nonaerobics
are &quot;lazy&quot; (19). </i></p>

<p>People are stigmatized, when they are considered by certain people as
behaving or being unhealthy. Who are these people executing the power of
stigmatization? Certainly, they are not the majority because the majority
never stigmatizes itself. Thus, there is a minority of people telling the
majority not only what is right and what is wrong, but also blaming those
who do not follow their verdict as being &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;guilty&quot;,
&quot;ill&quot;, &quot;having no will-power&quot;, etc. This minority consists
of representatives of the medical professions, self-styled experts in health
matters, priest of a good life, politicians of some kind, and just normal
people. What they are doing is to define a morale concerning health as
<i>they</i> understand the term <i>health</i>. They are in the business
of political correctness, as it is called in these days. In other words:
what they are doing is defining a certain kind of policy aiming at the
regulation of daily social life. There is nothing correct with political
correctness. It presents the structural approach to push individuals to
conformity within set standards. </p>

<p>10. </p>

<p>Freud and subsequently all of his disciples have been wrong. Identity
is an abstract concept with no relation to the daily life of humans. Body,
mind and soul are separated immediately as they are perceived prenatally,
natally and postnatally. As soon as we perceive, we are differentiated
in the one who perceives and the one who is perceived. Perception as well
as experience are human domains which are fundamentally linked to something
else beyond the individual; the same is true regarding action and behavior.
Without counterparts, no perception and experience is possible. We are
what we are, because there are others. Instead of saying &quot;I&quot;,
we should always say &quot;we&quot;, because the &quot;I&quot; does not
exist. It is fictional, a theoretical construct which gives us the impression
of being a whole person which we have never been. Again, this seems strange
at first glance. If one realizes the interdependence of individual development
and social, economic, cultural, and ecological conditions, however, it
becomes clear that the idea of the &quot;individual&quot; is perfectly
inappropriate. The individual presents always the ensemble of these conditions
shaped by his/her personal interpretation. Individuality is dependent upon
and performed in the context of social, economic, cultural, and ecological
conditions. </p>

<p>Psychological development makes us beings of different qualities at
the same point in time. We will never be <i>whole</i>, perhaps we will
only be able to perform as someone who respects body, mind and soul. There
will always be the difference between the suggested timelessness of mind
and soul and the real timeliness of the body. </p>

<p>In many aspects, the body is independent from the mind. Why should we
have education, even health education or smoking cessation? We have established
agencies of body control with regard to these and other domains because
we are aware of the incompatibility of mind and body, at least that is
what we believe. We feel that the body has to be controlled in order to
make it functional according to values and norms of our social systems.
Controlling the body is the ultimate function of mind over matter. </p>

<p>Descartes, in the 17th century, recognized the difficulties of bringing
mind and body into one concept, that is, he stated their incompatibility.
He wrote: </p>

<p><i>I am thinking, therefore I exist. (...) I was a substance whose whole
essence or nature is solely to think, and which does not require any place,
or depend on any material thing, in order to exist. Accordingly this 'I'
- that is, the soul by which I am what I am - is entirely distinct from
the body, and indeed is easier to know than the body, and would not fail
to be whatever it is, even if the body did not exist (Descartes 1988, 36).</i><br>
</p>

<p>Descartes felt the carnal aspects of human existence are harder to understand
than the mental. One can feel some anxiety shining through his statement
as far as the body is concerned. The body seems to represent the wild,
while the mind the &quot;civilized&quot;. Unfortunately, there have been
too many who have agreed with Descartes. Some in these days, who have their
doubts about Descartes' concept, are insurance companies. They know very
well that people tend to mix mind and matter for whatever reasons; rationality
may not be the overall and most important characteristic of human beings.
As humans are an entity of body, mind and soul, they are hardly in a position
to split the complexity of their bodily, emotional and intellectual experience
into different domains of distinctive relevance. Every human action encompasses
body, mind and soul. We are never able to perform only one of these aspects,
which is the reason why we are truly unique as individuals because each
of us performs a typical mixture of body, mind and soul. If we were rational
or even logic, we would behave in very similar ways because logic, for
example, is a clearly defined method of dealing with intellectual topics.
Computers perform excellently in this domain - and this makes them look
very much the same. Humans mix it all up - and this makes them look very
differently. </p>

<p>11. </p>

<p>Carl F. Rogers argues there is the opportunity to merge mind and body.
He goes so far as to state life may be incomplete without the merge. In
one of his last publications he wrote: </p>

<p><i>Most of us consist of two separated parts, trying desperately to
bring themselves together into an integrated soma, where the distinctions
between mind and body, feelings and intellect, would be obliterated (Rogers
1980, 252)</i> </p>

<p>I am not quite sure whether we are &quot;desperate&quot; to bring mind
and body together. I am, however, rather sure, that we think about this
antagonism without mostly finding a solution to the problem. In the end,
I feel we tend to believe that body and mind are completely separated from
each other. We do think this way because we hardly experience the suggested
entity of body, mind and soul consciously. </p>

<p>All this <i>new age</i> frenzy contaminating mainly middle and upper
class people of developed countries is nothing less but an indicator for
the manifest belief there may be more than just carnal aspects of life.
In this context, the carnal, however, gets degraded to the extent of not
being substantial for human existence. Emphasis is put on mental and spiritual
encounters. Specific exercises are suggested to reach a level of &quot;consciousness&quot;
enabling the individual to go beyond the limits of the body. It is again
mind over matter. </p>

<p>The basic concept of training of <i>new age</i> groups resembles the
master-apprentice relationship of traditional guilds in pre-industrial
centuries. It reflects an hierarchical approach of education, i.e. it creates
dependence during the training period while simultaneously instilling feelings
of superiority among the students thereby enabling them to perform successfully
after &quot;graduation&quot;. We seem to have a strong need to become technicians
of body, mind and soul. </p>

<p>12. </p>

<p>In the Bible it is written: </p>

<p><i>The light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single,
thy whole body shall be full of light</i> <i>(Matthew 6:22).</i> </p>

<p>The Koran says: </p>

<p><i>Enjoin believing man to turn their eyes away from temptation and
to restrain their carnal desires. This will make their lives purer (Al-Nur
24:30).</i> </p>

<p>The Bhagavad-Gita comments: </p>

<p><i>Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills
everything (Chapter10, Text 33).</i> </p>

<p>13. </p>

<p>Body feelings may be defined as the ultimate and unconditioned process
of communication between psyche and soma. That is, we can never be sure
what these processes are all about because psyche and soma are equally
involved in shaping the perception, if not producing it. When talking about
the body, we are actually talking about psyche-soma-psyche-communication.
All ends up in the brain - even the deadliest disease. We know of patients
fighting terminal disease with unconventional measures - more of them survived
than we imagine (Cousins 1981, Kaplun 1992). </p>

<p>Of course, they did not survive because of knowing the ultimate formula.
They survived because of what they were doing was just the right thing
for them in the right environment. The power of the mind is indisputable.
However, since it is a matter of living conditions, and subsequently education
and lifestyles, the power of the mind is based on social class. <i>New
age</i> is not a matter of insight alone but of being in a position to
create this type of insight. It is a matter of the material conditions
someone enjoys. </p>

<p>14. </p>

<p>Our life has become a matter of organization. Management of time and
appointments determines our daily behavior. We have become obsessed with
time management to an extent being contraproductive (Burns 1993). And those
who are not organized, like unemployed people or welfare clients, but also
those who do not affiliate themselves to any particular organization, are
disrespected in many ways, as William Greider observed in the USA: </p>

<p><i>The problem of modern democracy is rooted in its neglect of unorganized
people (Greider 1992, 104).</i> </p>

<p>They seem to be &quot;outlaws&quot;, and do not seem to &quot;fit in&quot;.
It is one of the spectacular contradictions of Western democracy that it
stands for freedom albeit simultaneously requesting loyalty and personal
commitment regarding community- and other organizations. </p>

<p>Freedom gets spoiled when people are too much organized or when they
are forced into organizations. Individual and collective opportunism may
be the likely result. On the other side, unorganized people have difficulties
to get heard. We are facing a dilemma which cannot be solved. In our general
values, we promote individual liberty. All of the democratic constitutions
put emphasis on this issue thereby intending to protect the individual
from collective and organizational threats. Minorities, as it is often
stated, are to be protected by all means. On the other side, we almost
only listen to organized people, i.e. minorities have to organize themselves
to get a foot into the door to political respect. </p>

<p>As far as individuals are concerned, we only offer them a rather problematic
idea. According to the prevailing ideology of capitalistic societies, everyone
has the chance to develop his/her potential to the fullest extent. The
ideology of the <i>self-made man</i> has psychological consequences as
Romanyshyn &amp; Whalen (1987) state: </p>

<p><i>This dream embodies the promise that one can create oneself, fashion
one's personality in whatever way one wishes. In effect, the self-made
man is the creator of his own home, the one who 'makes his own place' in
the world (Romanyshyn &amp; Whalen 1987, 203-204)</i><br>
</p>

<p><i>The self-made man breaks free from the bonds of tradition and home
only for the sake of creating an ideal home and thus weaving his own history.
This figure denies the very thing he strives for, fleeing his historical
roots in order to give birth to his own conception of himself. This soul's
flight from home, from its origins and its past, characterizes the depressive
soul (Romanyshyn &amp; Whalen 1987, 207)</i><br>
</p>

<p>The side-effects of becoming a <i>self-made man </i>or a <i>self-made
woman</i> seem to be serious, not only in terms of mental and physical
health but particularly with regard to collective aspects of human life.
The <i>self-made man</i> represents one type of <i>busy bodies</i> (Kimbrell
1993). He runs into the trap of becoming increasingly unable to sustain
his concept of life without major shifts in his psychological perspectives
which would unfortunately result in the demolition of the <i>self-made
man</i>'s dream: </p>

<p><i>... the cognizance of death humiliates the self-made man. In destroying
his project of self-creation it asks him to search beyond himself for another
reason for his being. In a quite literal way it returns him to the earth,
to the soil of the land, for men are dust and to dust they shall return.
Death reconnects man to the earth (Romanyshyn &amp; Whalen 1987, 210-211).</i>
</p>

<p>In other words, what is offered to the individual is the dream of becoming
a truly unique <i>self-made man</i>; however, while pursuing the dream,
he/she will find out that it is impossible to live the dream to the end.
With the cognizance of the timeliness of the body, i.e. by recognizing
the limits of material existence, the dream becomes obsolete. After having
been set on the track in earlier years of life, the track seems to be set
aside before one's eyes in later years. Is that not a pretty dirty trick?
</p>

<p>15. </p>

<p>In many cultures, people tend to perceive themselves and others as social
beings rather than as <i>embodied</i> persons. The body seems to be a rather
difficult issue in social communication except in terms of illness, disease
and sports. However, as Bryan S. Turner states in his book <i>The body
and society</i>: <i>&quot;...human beings are embodied, just as they are
enselved&quot; </i>(Turner 1984, 1), and he continues: </p>

<p><i>The body is the most proximate and immediate feature of my social
self, a necessary feature of my social location and of my personal enselfment
and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in the natural
environment (Turner 1984, 8)</i> </p>

<p>The body is the bearer of the human being and at the same time the expression
of his/her existential, i.e., economic, political, social, cultural and
environmental situation. Individual and social biography are represented
in the body, as are the social and cultural circumstances in which it developed;
moreover, economic and ecological living conditions also find their expression
in the human body. Therefore, body awareness, bodily experiences and bodily
expressions are not only subject to individual choices of one lifestyle
over another; they are primarily structured by social communication and
interaction, both of which are dependent upon the symbolic structure of
the social system, i.e., the value system, normative expectations and symbolic
categories such as health, wealth, happiness, satisfaction, power, etc.
Relationships between the individual and collective, between personal and
social development, between economic and ecological processes are both
directly sensed and expressed by the body. </p>

<p><i>Each culture has its own characteristic manner of locomotion, sitting,
standing, reclining, and gesturing. (Hall 1977, 75).</i> </p>

<p>Certain bodily behaviors are directly related to well-being or illness.
People who suffer move differently than those who feel healthy and energetic.
People who feel socially accepted and supported move differently than those
who do not. Someone who feels self-assured, positive and mentally strong
communicates with a different body language than someone who feels depressed,
oppressed or simply of low mood. All of these expressions are socially
and culturally shaped. As Crawford states: </p>

<p><i>The body is a cultural object. As our most immediate natural symbol
it provides us with a powerful medium through which we interpret and give
expression to our individual and social experience. 'Human nature', the
category of the inevitable (and often the desirable), finds its truth in
the body. We live within a nature/culture opposition and the 'natural body'
confirms our place within a more 'authentic' order. It is a vital foundation
upon which behavior and values are predicated. Conversely, as a symbol
of nature the body must be contained and transformed by culture. We invest
the body with culture, thereby distinguishing ourselves from the rest of
nature. Moreover, our biological being, always mediated by culture, delimits
many of our most important social roles. It defines us in relation to others
in kinship, sex, age groups, and larger social units such as race or caste.
Bodily states are key markers in which are invested the social definitions
of the self - not only regarding role, but normality and abnormality. The
body also supplies a universally experienced model of a living and dynamic
unit, an organic whole, a prototype from which we can draw in our attempts
to explain and give meaning to larger social units and experiences. It
is our richest source for metonymy and metaphor (Crawford 1984, 60-61).</i>
</p>

<p>However, these different aspects of the body are rarely perceived consciously.
We almost always make our way through this world without realizing that
we use our body in manifold ways at every moment in time. We may be engaged
in selecting clothes to underline our body shape; we may take care of our
body in terms of health care and cosmetics; we may realize that we have
a body when we feel ill. But on a day-to-day basis, we rarely experience
our body language, our bodily behavior at all. This is one of the reasons
why we are often surprised when we see ourselves in videos or listen to
our recorded voice, both of which seem rather strange because we are not
experienced to see ourselves the same way as we are seen by others. Our
&quot;manners of locomotion&quot; are surprising for us, even more so when
we follow Hall's statement: </p>

<p><i>Viewing movies in very slow motion, looking for synchrony, one realizes
that what we know as dance is really a slowed-down, stylized version of
what human beings do whenever they interact (Hall, 1977, 72)</i> </p>

<p>This is an amazing perspective on body behavior and interaction. </p>

<p>Our body concept has been shaped by what society and/or culture considers
to be relevant. As society provides fashion, it fashions our material conditions.
</p>

<p>16. </p>

<p>The body is difficult to understand. It refers at least to </p>

<ul>
<li>a physiological system, </li>

<li>a substrate of psychological processes, </li>

<li>a composition of psyche and soma, </li>

<li>a social and cultural domain of experience and action, </li>

<li>an economically defined commodity. </li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, the body is multidimensional, it is contrary to the
occidental type of logic, it is something for which we hardly have any
analytical tool. While we may measure certain bodily performances, we cannot
be sure that this type of measure really relates to what we suppose to
measure. In many cases of epidemiology, we have become aware that physiological
indicators not necessarily relate to health or the quality of life. Other
than physiological categories seem to be more important to analyze and
predict morbidity and mortality (Blaxter 1990, Phillimore, Beattie &amp;
Townsend 1994). </p>

<p>Body is a complex domain - in almost every aspect imaginable. Time related
to body matches this kind of complexity: </p>

<p><i>Body time is a multicomponent, multimedia affair. It is put together
from a conglomerate of clocks, some clearly important, others not so important
and still others occupying an ambiguous rung on the ladder of temporal
status. But the clocks are not isolated units, each one responsible for
driving a particular rhythm independently of all the rest; clocks interact,
influence and are influenced, modulate, entrain, couple and uncouple, in
a highly mobile set of relationships, which are mediated by messages encoded
as chemistry and as electrical impulses in the nervous system. Some clocks
are strong, some are weak, some are more independent than others, some
are tuned to environmental time cues to which other clocks turn a blind
eye. We cannot really talk about the &quot;regulation&quot; of biological
time, although people often do, because that is the language of the master
clock hypothesis. We must speak rather about the coordination of a multiplicity
which under the right conditions can become a unity (Campell 1989, 113).</i>
</p>

<p>The complexity of body and time refers to the complexity of life itself.
As humans, we deal both with natural and social factors of ourselves and
our environments. We simply cannot reduce the effects of this complexity
by building organizations and institutions, and developing values and norms
designed for the regulation of our daily life. Although they represent
examples of reduced complexity, they nevertheless cannot circumnavigate
the fundamental complexity of life and its effects on each and everyone
of us. In principle, we are not able to get away with biology, physics,
nature and whatever has been here on this planet before we arrived. We
are shaped by nature although we have gone a long way in shaping it as
much as we can. </p>

<p>Beyond our relation to nature, we have gone similarly far concerning
the social organization of bodily behaviors. Social systems introduce values
and norms by which the effectiveness of their functions is measured. A
micro-analysis of social interaction demonstrates that our daily interactions
are to a vast extent ritualized. Societies claiming to be rational, organize
many of their social situations as rituals. Rituals, however, have the
peculiar connotation of being sets of interaction in which people participate
without questioning the meaning of their participation because the meaning
is represented by the ritual as such. Rituals are sets of interaction in
which no individual input is required - just attendance and obedience to
the rules, i.e. bodies in time become timeless bodies because they do not
count given the transcendent quality of rituals. </p>

<p>17. </p>

<p>We are living on Planet Earth, but we can hardly understand the reasons
why this planet impinges these kinds of lifestyles and living and working
conditions on us or why we have been able to develop them this way. We
dance through the neatly fenced universe of our societies without realizing
their randomness. We are made believe and we proactively believe that this
environment shall be the human environment, i.e. the environment humans
made and are made for. Why are we so sure that we are what we (most often)
pretend to be? We have developed <i>social systems</i> to which numerous
social scientists devote their working life and still, we do not come up
with a consistent understanding of our circumstances. Of course, there
are these cultural, social, economic, political, and historical differences.
However, is it really only a matter of these differences that we do not
understand the world we are living in? </p>

<p>Let me reduce complexity to a superficially easy issue: we do not recognize
that there are limits for our understanding of what <i>body</i> and <i>time</i>
may mean. The English psychiatrist Ronald D. Laing takes a rather pragmatic
position when stating: </p>

<p><i>I, for instance, regard any particular man as finite, as one who
has had a beginning and who will have an end. He has been born, and he
is going to die. In the meantime, he has a body that roots him to this
time and this place (Laing 1965, 25-26).</i><br>
</p>

<p>Contrary to Laing, although not contradicting his conception basically,
we may find other body-concepts anywhere else in this world. Fortunately,
as I would say, and unfortunately, as others would say, it is difficult
to find the truth. Maybe the truth of the body lies in the few seconds
everyone may perceive shortly before dying. Wouldn't that be the perfect
irony of human bodily existence? </p>
