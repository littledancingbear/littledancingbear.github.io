<font size=+2>Introduction</font>
<p>
New concepts are introduced to social science on a regular basis. In relation to their 
conceptual and strategic development, health promotion and public health are customers 
of social, behavioral and other sciences. One of the latest concepts creating some waves 
among health promotors is called <i>social capital</i>. As we can see with the theme of this 
conference, it has finally reached conference status. Social capital is no longer just 
the flavor of the month, it has grown into a concept seriously adopted by health promotion 
and public health alike. How has that happened and why was health promotion so easily 
infected?

<p>
In this paper we argue that the philosophy, on which social capital is based, is 
incompatible with the basic philosophy of health promotion as expressed in the Ottawa 
Charter. While social capital assumes that all of us sit in one boat aiming at the same 
objectives with the same strategies in mind, the Ottawa Charter clearly states that we 
live in a world of different cultures, interests, values, and beliefs, and that health 
promotion means struggle and dealing with conflicting interests. The philosophical 
difference between social capital and health promotion lies in the difference of social 
harmony and social conflicts.

<p>
In order to be able to understand the differences between the concepts, we need to step 
back and look at their origins. This is particularly important in the case of social 
capital because the concept has become rather fuzzy, since it has been adopted by 
social and behavioral sciences in the past few years.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<font size=+2>Health promotion</font>

<p>
Health promotion according to the Ottawa Charter (WHO 1986), is supposed to initiate 
and drive processes of social change aiming at the improvement of living and working 
conditions conducive to health. Guided by three principles, i.e. enabling, mediating 
and advocating, health promotion activities are grouped into five areas:

<ul type=disc>
<li>
building healthy public policies
<li>
creating supportive environments
<li>
strengthening community action
<li>
developing personal skills, and
<li>
reorienting health services.
</li>
</ul>

All of these areas, and particular regarding the guiding principles of action, 
demonstrate that health promotion aims at levels of collective action with regard 
to the improvement of individual and collective health conditions.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<font size=+2>Empowerment</font>

<p>
The key strategic concept guiding the Ottawa Charter is empowerment 
(Rappaport et al. 1984), a concept developed in the context of social work and community 
organization. Empowerment is defined in different ways (Rappaport et al. 1984), but there 
are some common elements to all definitions:

<ul type=disc>
<li>
empowerment aims at the improvement of individual and collective skills to regain 
control over living and working conditions and their impact on well-being 
(Henderson & Thomas 1987)
<li>
empowerment is the aim and the means of community organization (Minkler 1997)
<li>
empowerment refers to a constant process of enabling individuals and groups to take 
part in collective action (Daly & Cobb 1994).
</li>
</ul>

Empowerment refers to processes of social interaction of individuals and groups, which 
aim at enabling people to enhance their individual and collective skills and the scope 
and range of controlling their lives in a given community. Empowerment happens while 
people interact in ways of mutual respect, tolerance and social support. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<font size=+2>Social capital</font>

<p>
The concept of social capital has emerged from sociological analyses concerning the quality 
of social relations and their impact on the lives of their participants. Social capital 
was seen by the late James S. Coleman as an ingredient of the functioning of social 
relations among individuals (Coleman 1990). Participants of these relations demonstrated 
trust and confidence in each other, which helps enabling them as a social group to become 
successful in social, cultural, and political terms.  Social capital according to Coleman's 
analysis refers to sociability and consequently to social status of the individual, which 
are seen to provide the main foundations for successful social relations.

<p>
Robert D. Putnam (1994) re-defined social capital by referring to social organizations 
and institutions in Italy and the ways and means how they collaborate in common projects. 
He found that trust and confidence are major ingredients of successful performance of 
these organizations when it comes to political and governmental reform. Trust and 
confidence are results of historical processes in which these organizations have been 
taken part, and not just outcomes of spontaneous developments in relation to specific 
political topics.

<p>
Social capital refers to the macro-level of the analysis of social systems thereby 
looking into mechanisms of cooperation and conflict between social sectors. It assumes 
that cooperation between sectors generates a stock of social capital, i.e. the essential 
resource enabling agencies to further cooperate because of the benefits this cooperation 
generates for all participants. Behind the concept of social capital lies the idea of a 
well-balanced social system, which favors mutual collaboration between social agencies 
and sectors for the sake of the sustainability of this system itself. 

<p>
In other words: social capital refers to benefits generated by collaboration between 
established social organizations.<sup><a href="#Anm4">4)</a></sup><a name="AAnm4"> These benefits 
particularly require generating trust and confidence between organizations in relation 
to further projects of collaboration. Like monetary capital, social capital becomes a 
resource to exercise power vis-à-vis those who have only limited or even no access 
to this resource.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<font size=+2><i>Homo oeconomicus sanitatis</i></font>

<p>
The essential idea behind the concept of social capital in the context of public health 
is the homo oeconomicus sanitatis. That is, human beings, who 

<ul type=disc>
<li>
view themselves primarily as actors aiming at gaining maximum benefits from their 
investment in themselves;
<li>
calculate their behavior according to individual risk assessment, whereby risks are 
interpreted in monetary and social costs;
<li>
direct their action towards the generation of power, influence and "trust" in order to 
become accepted partners within relationships aiming at the provision of equal benefits 
for all partners involved. 
</li>
</ul>

In the context of public health and health promotion, social capital refers to the 
health entrepreneur, that is the individual who sees health as a powerful ingredient 
for improving their chances in the market of social opportunities. The individual 
becomes the entrepreneur responsible for his/her own social life. In other words, 
humans become the subject of economic calculations aiming at improving benefits from 
whatever social action is taken. Following this conceptualization, life degenerates to 
a market-place characterized by economic calculation and control of risks, profits and 
losses.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<font size=+2>Empowerment vs. social capital</font>

<p>
Health promotion aims at improving living and working conditions conducive to health. 
We know from numerous studies that the socio-economic conditions of a society present 
the major influence on public health and consequently on the quality of life of the 
people (Wilkinson 1996). Socio-economic conditions refer to employment and unemployment, 
level of education, income, occupational position and others. Quality of life is related to 
the biological, physical, social, cultural, and political environment in which people live. Both conditions, the socio-economic and the environmental, are beyond the individual's control. They form parts of society, which impact on individuals' development and growth. This does not mean that these conditions cannot be changed. But it is a fact that an individual alone may not able to change them according to her/his preferences.

<p>
Societies are subject to constant change because they are generated every day through 
human interaction in public places, social institutions, and every social sector being 
part of the particular society. As much as societies can be seen as constant collective 
processes, they also provide boundaries for these processes in terms of institutions and 
organizations, and through norms and values guiding social interaction. When individuals 
and groups intend to bring about social change in the five activity areas of the Ottawa 
Charter, they will be confronted with different interests and priorities among the 
stakeholders in these areas. For example, the re-orientation of the health care system 
has not taken place in any of the so-called developed countries. On the contrary, we seem 
to witness a re-medicalization of health promotion and public health (Wenzel 1997).

<p>
Empowerment is the aim of social interaction in the context of public health. The Ottawa 
Charter suggests that people need to gain control over their living and working conditions 
in order to be able to develop lifestyles conducive to health. People need to form 
alliances in order to gain political strength and power necessary to support their causes. 
Alliance refers to individuals, groups and/or organization cooperating with regard to a 
specific topic and providing mutual assistance and support. Alliances are not 
partnerships, but political frames of cooperation within a defined time spectrum. They 
are strategic in nature, and they do not necessarily mean that the parties share common 
interests, values and beliefs other than in the particular case of the alliance.

<p>
However, the social capital concept suggests that individuals, groups, and organizations 
sit in one boat and need to collaborate in "partnership" to achieve the objectives of 
health promotion. "Partnerships" are defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "an 
association of two or more persons for the carrying on of a business, of which they 
share the expenses, profit and loss". Social capital assumes that all members of the 
partnership have equal interests and equal access to all resources needed for this 
collaboration, and in addition it assumes that all players will equally benefit from 
the collaboration. These assumptions seem to be unrealistic given the vast inequalities 
in health in all countries of the world (WHO 1999). Their major cause lies in the 
unequal distribution of wealth (income), and consequently in inequalities regarding 
education, employment, and access to social, political, and economic resources.

<p>
Change will not come automatically, it needs to be struggled and striven for by those 
who wish to see more equality in society than currently exists. The Ottawa Charter offers 
a strategic frame of reference for health promotion. This frame has not been put into 
practice to the extent that we would be able to decide upon its appropriateness and 
suitability. Instead of implementing what we have promised some 13 years ago, we hop 
from declaration to declaration and in-between we introduce new "concepts". In this 
intellectual exercise we seem to have forgotten that health promotion supposedly links 
to real people living under real living conditions which in most cases are not conducive 
to their health.

<p>
"Partnerships in health", as suggested by the Jakarta Declaration on Health Promotion 
into the 21st century (WHO 1997), are an ideological metaphor, covering up differences 
in health and wealth, rather than disclosing ways and means how to overcome inequalities 
in health. The individual health worker in Australia may sit in the same boat with a 
company like Johnson & Johnson, but that does not mean that both have the same capacities 
when it comes to shaping social, cultural, political, environmental, and economic living 
and working conditions and their impact on health. We feel it is unethical to propagate 
ways and means of collaboration between "partners", who may not have more in common than 
a general interest in health, but are different as regards access to all resources 
relevant to bring about social change in favor of living and working conditions 
conducive to health. Among others, these resources are power, money, expertise, 
and media and they are distributed unequally between socio-economic, ethnic, age, 
and gender groups in any given society.

<p>
If health promotion would work with the concept of social capital it will degenerate 
to an ideology in praise of social marketing. Social marketing does not reflect on 
issues like community participation or community involvement, but presents a formula 
by which messages can be transmitted to "target audiences" (Kotler & Roberto 1989). 
The idea is that people listen to these messages and if they are developed to perfection, 
people may adopt them and change the related aspects of their lives accordingly. In other 
words: social marketing is about persuasion and it provides the "psychological technology" 
to develop and transmit messages accordingly. Social change will become a matter of 
rhetoric.

<p>
In contrast, empowerment refers to social change in societies characterized by 
conflicting interests of different groups and organizations, and realized in social 
action. It acknowledges that health promotion and public health are topics, which 
need to be put on political agendas and be included in budgets in order to provide 
opportunities and resources for practical change. This can only happen when people 
form alliances and subsequently engage in social action to bring about substantial 
changes of their living and working conditions.
