Standing Committee: Indigenous Health</a>
- <font size="2">"In view of the unacceptably high morbidity and mortality of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community 
Affairs was requested, during the Thirty-Eighth Parliament, to conduct an inquiry into 
Indigenous Health. The Committee was unable to complete its work due to the dissolution of 
the House of Representatives on 30 August 1998. Consequently, the Committee, on 12 January 
1999 was asked by the Minister for Health and Aged Care to complete this inquiry in the 
Thirty-Ninth Parliament, reporting on the same terms of reference as follows:  

<ul type=disc>
<li>
ways to achieve effective Commonwealth co-ordination of the provision of health and 
related programs to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, with particular 
emphasis on the regulation, planning and delivery of such services;
<li>
barriers to access to mainstream health services, to explore avenues to improve the 
capacity and quality of mainstream health service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people and the development of linkages between Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander and mainstream services;
<li>
the need for improved education of medical practitioners, specialists, nurses and health 
workers, with respect to the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and 
its implications for care;
<li>
the extent to which social and cultural factors and location, influence health, especially 
maternal and child health, diet, alcohol and tobacco consumption;
<li>
the extent to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health status is affected by 
educational and employment opportunities, access to transport services and proximity to 
other community supports, particularly in rural and remote communities; and
<li>
the extent to which past structures for delivery of health care services have contributed to 
the poor health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people"
