<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><B>UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS</B> 
<HR></H1>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United
Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
the full text of which appears in the following pages. Following this historic
act the Assembly called upon all Member countries to publicize the text
of the Declaration and &quot;to cause it to be disseminated, displayed,
read and expounded principally in schools and other educational institutions,
without distinction based on the political status of countries or territories.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Final Authorized Text by UNITED NATIONS OFFICE OF PUBLIC
INFORMATION </FONT>
<HR></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>PREAMBLE</B> </FONT></P>

<P>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable
rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom,
justice and peace in the world, </P>

<P>Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a
world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and
freedom from fear and want has beep proclaimed as the highest aspiration
of the common people, </P>

<P>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse,
as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human
rights should be protected by the rule of law, </P>

<P>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations
between nations, </P>

<P>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed
their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the
human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined
to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
</P>

<P>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation
with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance
of human rights and fundamental freedoms, </P>

<P>Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the
greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge, </P>

<P>Now, Therefore, </P>

<P>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY </P>

<P>proclaims </P>

<P>THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement
for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every
organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive
by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms
and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their
universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples
of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under
their jurisdiction.
