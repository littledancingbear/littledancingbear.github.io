<p>This will serve as the archive of the LDB.org site. It was set up by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_Wenzel">Eberhard Wenzel</a> -- and this is a quote from his Wikipedia page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eberhard R. Wenzel (2 January 1950 â€“ 20 September 2001) was a public health researcher, a co-founder of the WWW Virtual Library: Public Health, and an advocate of the socio-ecological view of health promotion as described in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. He was a Senior Lecturer of International Health at Griffith University, and Deputy Director of Queensland Centre for Public Health. Griffith University's "Eberhard Wenzel Scholarship for International Public Health" and The Australian Health Promotion Association's "Eberhard Wenzel Memorial Oration" are named in his honour.</p>
<p>Born in Heringen, Hesse, West Germany, Wenzel worked as a researcher, lecturer and consultant at various universities and institutes in Germany, in the fields of educational technology, media didactics and sociology. He worked in collaboration with the World Health Organization, European Centre for Social Welfare Training and Research and several other organisations researching health education and health promotion. He later moved, first to the Philippines where he taught at the University of the Philippines, and then to Australia as a lecturer at Griffith University in Brisbane.</p>
<p>Eberhard Wenzel co-founded the Public Health section of the World Wide Web Virtual Library, which during the period in which he moderated it, earned a rating of the best in the field by the medical journal The Lancet.</p>
<p>Throughout 2001, Eberhard Wenzel shared his battle with cancer by setting up a "healing circle" and "The Big C Report" on his website. His last entry occurred on 17 September that year, only three days before he died. His website, which contains more than 800 separate pages covering a wide range of topics, has been preserved as it was on 17 September 2001 as a memorial to his life and work.</p>
