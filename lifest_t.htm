<p>Me: What is your lifestyle? </p>

<p>You: What? </p>

<p>Me: Your lifestyle? </p>

<p>You: I have no idea what you're talking about. </p>

<p>Me: You've got some lifestyle, don't you? I mean you have a certain
way of life which is different from the ways other people have. </p>

<p>You: A certain way of life? Different from other people? I don't know.
I lead my life just as everyone else does it in the neighborhood. I'm not
different from them. I don't want to be different from them. They are my
friends, my neighbors. I don't know what you're talking about. Is that
one of your fancy words again? Lifestyles? Funny word. As if life would
need any style. Life is life. It doesn't need a style, does it? </p>

<p>Me: Well, do you say that your way of life is the same as your neighbors'?
</p>

<p>You: What do you mean by &quot;the same&quot;? </p>

<p>Me: Are you doing, feeling, thinking the same as your neighbors do?
</p>

<p>You: Of course not. Everyone is different from everybody. I mean, I'm
wearing different shirts than my neighbor does. </p>

<p>Me: Do you like the <i>Chicago Bulls</i>? </p>

<p>You: No. Not at all. They're too big. No, I don't like big things. </p>

<p>Me: Does one of your neighbors like the <i>Chicago Bulls</i>? </p>

<p>You: Why do you want to know? They can like whom they want. It's none
of your business. </p>

<p>Me: I don't investigate, I just want to know whether there is someone
who likes the <i>Chicago Bulls</i> because I want to talk with you about
lifestyles. </p>

<p>You: What have the <i>Chicago Bulls</i> to do with lifestyles? It's
a basketball-team. Nothing to do with lifestyles. </p>

<p>Me: I'm not sure, and maybe you will recognize that they've got something
to do with them. So, please, just tell me: any fans of the <i>Bulls</i>
in your neighborhood? </p>

<p>You: Of course. I mean, anybody would be stupid not to be a fan of Michael
Jordan. Sure, there are lots of <i>Bulls</i>-fans around. </p>

<p>Me: So, you're living your way of life in a neighborhood in which there
are friends and neighbors who don't share your preferences regarding the
<i>Bulls</i>? </p>

<p>You: Nobody has to share my preferences. We don't live together because
of preferences. </p>

<p>Me: Are you sure? </p>

<p>You: Of course, because we live together, because ... </p>

<p>Me: You like each other? </p>

<p>You: No. Not necessarily. I mean there's some people I don't like at
all but they're living here because they ain't living somewhere else. </p>

<p>Me: Why don't they live somewhere else? </p>

<p>You: I don't know. Maybe, it's convenient here. Maybe, they can afford
to live here but not somewhere else. Maybe, they like it here. Well, probably
not because of this because some of them we don't like very much and they
still keep living here. Yes, I guess it's because it's convenient here.
</p>

<p>Me: You mean, people live here because they can afford living here and
not somewhere else? </p>

<p>You: Maybe they could live somewhere else, but here, it's convenient
for them for whatever reasons. </p>

<p>Me: Money? </p>

<p>You: Certainly. </p>

<p>Me: Similar background? </p>

<p>You: What do you mean by &quot;background&quot;? </p>

<p>Me: Perhaps they have similar jobs than the rest of the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>You: Some of them have. </p>

<p>Me: So, this is the kind of lifestyle they can afford. </p>

<p>You: I don't understand what you mean by &quot;lifestyle&quot;. They're
living here, I don't like them. For them it's convenient. But I don't reject
them either. So, that's it. Nothing to do with lifestyles. </p>

<p>Me: You talk with them? </p>

<p>You: Of course, they're humans, aren't they? We speak the same language.
</p>

<p>Me: Language? </p>

<p>You: Sure. None of them would talk about lifestyles. Nobody uses this
word. It's strange, kind of upper-class. Yeah, it's the rich folks' language.
We don't talk that way. We don't have lifestyles. We live. </p>

<p>Me: So you speak the same language? </p>

<p>You: Hm. </p>

<p>Me: Then you share quite a lot. </p>

<p>You: What do you mean? </p>

<p>Me: Those who speak the same language share the same culture. They have
a lot in common. They see the world through similar eyes. </p>

<p>You: How many beers have you had? </p>

<p>Me: Why? </p>

<p>You: You're talking strange things. </p>

<p>Me: I just said that you share a lot. We don't seem to share a lot.
You don't seem to understand me. </p>

<p>You: I don't understand you? Oh no, boy, I understand a lot of you.
You're a talker. You're this health-talker. Always putting on people. </p>

<p>Me: I'm not putting on people. I just talk with them. But it's difficult
to understand each other, isn't it? </p>

<p>You: No wonder. You don't live here. So how can you understand me? I
mean, we speak the same language but the same language is different. Different
meanings, different ways to think about everything. We're not health-talkers
here. We're people. Real people. </p>

<p>Me: I'm a real person, too. </p>

<p>You: Are you? </p>

<p>Me: Do you say, I'm not real? </p>

<p>You: Unfortunately, you're very real. You're a real pain in my neck.
</p>

<p>Me: Why? </p>

<p>You: Because you don't understand me although we speak the same language.
You use it differently. You talk in strange words. You don't feel how I
feel. You just approach me and start talking. You don't seem to know that
we don't like to be approached this way. Anyway, you've got a different
style. </p>

<p>Me: Aha, style! </p>

<p>You: Yeah, style. </p>

<p>Me: I thought only rich folks are into styles. </p>

<p>You: To me, you're a rich folk. </p>

<p>Me: But I'm not. </p>

<p>You: Well, then you are somebody else. Probably an academic or so. </p>

<p>Me: I'm a health worker. </p>

<p>You: Oh, come on, nobody is a health worker. There is no work in health.
It doesn't make sense. </p>

<p>Me: Let's get back to styles. You said, we may have different styles
of talking, right? </p>

<p>You: Sure. </p>

<p>Me: Maybe, we've got different styles of thinking. </p>

<p>You: Certainly. I can't think the way you do - too far out. </p>

<p>Me: Perhaps, we've got different attitudes. </p>

<p>You: Of course. </p>

<p>Me: And different beliefs? </p>

<p>You: Sure. </p>

<p>Me: And different educational backgrounds? </p>

<p>You: And different girl-friends, different cars, different houses, different
salaries, different tastes, different kids, different neighborhoods, and
so on. Yeah, we're different. </p>

<p>Me: We've got different ways of life? </p>

<p>You: You lead your life and I lead mine. </p>

<p>Me: They're different? </p>

<p>You: I hope so because I can't stand your style. </p>

<p>Me: My lifestyle? </p>

<p>You: Correct. </p>

<p>Me: So, you know what a lifestyle is? </p>

<p>You: Well, if it's what we just talked about, then I probably know what
this term means. But it's not a term we use here. </p>

<p>Me: O.K. Accepted. However, just for the purpose of this talk, let's
using the term for a while, o.k.? </p>

<p>You: Well. </p>

<p>Me: There's people who think that smoking is a lifestyle. What do feel
about that? </p>

<p>You: Smoking? A lifestyle? I'm not smoking all my life. I mean, if you
smoke you just do it once in a while. You can't build your life on smoking,
can you? Why do people say that smoking is a lifestyle? I don't see any
reason in it. </p>

<p>Me: Well, they say, smoking is a lifestyle because it's part of your
life if you are a smoker. </p>

<p>You: Then laughing is a lifestyle, too. Or bathing, eating, watching
TV. You mean, everything of you is a lifestyle? </p>

<p>Me: That's what some people say. </p>

<p>You: Who are they? </p>

<p>Me: Epidemiologist. </p>

<p>You: Epi-What? </p>

<p>Me: Health researchers. </p>

<p>You: Your friends? </p>

<p>Me: Colleagues. </p>

<p>You: Must be confused people. If you talk about <i>life</i>style, you
don't want to talk about sitting on the toilet. You don't want to know
about eating. I mean, if you want to get to know how I live, you've got
to move in my neighborhood and find out about all the kinds of things we
do, or say, or believe. Then you'll get to know a bit about me and my neighbors.
