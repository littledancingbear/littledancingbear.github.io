<FONT SIZE="+2">Introduction</FONT>

<P>
The preparation of an academic paper (essay, report, literature review, etc.) involves the researching of a topic, formulating the assembled information, ideas and conclusions into a logical scholarly format and the inclusion of original thoughts on the topic by the author. This web-page proposes some thoughts on how to prepare academic papers of a high standard.

<P>
The word "research" means search, inquiry, pursuit, and it comes from the French word "recherché" which means to seek again.

<P>
A research paper involves investigation of a subject for the purpose of revising accepted conclusions in the light of facts uncovered by the investigation.  A single source of information is not enough to conduct and write research, for the nature of research is to compare and contrast the multiple ideas of others with our own.

<P>
Writing an academic paper is not simply an information gathering process, nor a loosely paraphrased report. It is a thinking and shaping process for the purpose of communicating a point of view to others.  It therefore involves formulation of a major idea (thesis, hypothesis, premise) using information in order to share those ideas and conclusions with others.

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Presentation of the research</FONT>

<P>
A research paper should be circular in argument.  That is, the formal aim of the paper should be stated in the opening paragraph, the purpose of the paper should be stated in the opening paragraph, the conclusion should return to the opening, and examine the original purpose in the light of the data assembled.  A major error is often to present conclusions and make far reaching statements that are not directly related to the evidence previously presented.

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Steps involved in researching and writing an essay</FONT>

<P>
The following steps involve a logical sequence to the preparation of an essay and are intended to assist students in researching the topic and presenting a comprehensive written paper.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Examine the topic carefully and isolate the key words that will indicate what the question demands, for example, "evaluate", "illustrate", "analyse", "criticise" (see definitions below).

<P>
<LI>
Define specifically words of a general or ambiguous nature that may appear in the topic.

<P>
<LI>
Restrict your subject if the topic is too broad or too general for the assigned paper.

<P>
<LI>
Decide on the purpose of the paper.

<P>
<LI>
Make a tentative statement of your thesis - in other words the proposition you will attempt to defend, clarify and develop.

<P>
<LI>
Begin your preliminary search and reading.

<P>
<LI>
As you examine material, record bibliographic details, including author, title, publication details, and the page or pages on which information can be found

<P>
<LI>
Make a tentative outline of the major divisions of your paper

<P>
<LI>
Begin serious reading, taking notes - include paraphrasing of direct quotations, critical or evaluative comments.  Make notes as you go for each reference including the subject heading which may  form subdivisions of your outline.  You can do this directly on computer files for later inclusion in your essay, on a card system or paper sheets.  You can highlight sections of text on the source material (copies or your own, never on library copies) or make margin notes for later reference.  Ensure you record bibliographic details, for example if you subsequently wish to directly quote a source, you must have the page number of that source for the reader to verify or consult the full article.

<P>
<LI>
Formulate your thesis - state it simply, expressing the basic idea which you will develop;  restrict it to one approach to the subject.

<P>
<LI>
Study your notes in order to restrict the subject further if necessary.

<P>
<LI>
Make a preliminary outline with logical sequencing; fill in the gaps by additional reading and notetaking;  discard irrelevant material.

<P>
<LI>
Remake your outline.

<P>
<LI>
Write the first draft, revise and evaluate.

<P>
<LI>
Write the final draft.

<P>
<LI>
Spell check final draft and ensure grammatical construction is appropriate to give a 'scholarly' effect to the work.  Try and write in the third person and avoid personal pronouns such as 'I', 'you' and 'we'.
</LI>
</UL>

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">The planning and presentation of the final draft</FONT>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Establish your thesis, main idea or perspective in the introductory sections of your paper.  Focus the reader's attention on the problem to be addressed and the theme to be developed.

<P>
<LI> 
Develop your ideas in a sequence that will most effectively support your point of view.

<P>
<LI> 
Integrate your ideas and any reference materials used to consolidate your argument.

<P>
<LI>
Avoid a piecemeal handling of the topic.  Make sure your ideas develop in a logical and coherent way.  Attend to this in planning stages, working out successive steps in your essay.

<P>
<LI> 
Check continually to make sure you are answering the question.

<P>
<LI>
Conclude your assignment with some statement that will reinforce or consolidate your stated view point.

This is a term found more frequently in quantitative papers/research where mathematical calculations are involved than in qualitative paper/research.

<p>

In papers concerned with quantitative matters truth or falsity of a proposition is established by mathematical methods or controlled laboratory conditions.   More often, however, the notion of 'probability'  is established rather than proof.

<p>

Proof in papers concerned with qualitative matters carries the implication of something much less absolute than in quantitative papers.  It generally means to confirm or not confirm one's conclusion or evaluation of the subject under discussion.  Conclusions are expressed in tentative language such as: "The conclusion reached in this paper shows/reveals/ indicates or suggests an explanation for".

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Referencing and bibliographies</FONT>

<P>
In determining the extent of documentation a balance should be struck between the requirements of scholarship and ease of reading.  Excessive documentation can be distracting, while insufficient documentation may suggest a tenuous or poorly researched argument.

<P>
A list of references contains only those works cited in the text.  It is the author's responsibility to provide such a listing of any work in which the author-date system has been used to make reference to other published sources.  Generally works are listed in alphabetical order of their authors' names or source names.

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">How to Reference</FONT>

<P>
The purpose of referencing is to allow the reader to identify and locate the work being used.  It is therefore important to provide in a concise form all the necessary information for the work to be found.

<P>
The essential elements are:

<P>
Author(s) (Date of Publication), Title. Publisher and Place of Publication and the Page Number(s) of the passage cited.

<P>
There may also be an editor, compiler or translator, a number of editions in which case the name or the number of the edition used needs to be cited - or a series in which the book appears.  All of this information needs to be included if it was present in the material consulted.

<P>
Exactly where and in what form such information appears in your essay depends on the citation or reference system used.  The  two main systems used in the Humanities are the Oxford and Harvard systems.  What follows is a passage which illustrates both.

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">The Harvard System</FONT>

<P>
This is the way to apply the Harvard System to a passage:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
"You used to see them coming up Garden Street.  Dorothy across the road would join them.  7 o'clock every morning they used to all walk down to the mill.  Then you'd hear the whistle and you'd know it was time to get up. These whistles regulated your life as well as theirs.  It was strange when they stopped (Mrs Wilson,  Interview 1984).

<P>
The time when most whistles stopped in the textile mills of Geelong was during the early 1970s.  Long a centre of textile production, Geelong was particularly hard hit by the downturn when the 3,000 strong workforce was halved and sackings ran at 60 per cent during 1974 (The Geelong Advertiser 1974).  While in 1971, 3,364 people were members of the Textiles workers Union in the Geelong District, by 1973 this had dropped to 1,398 (Hughes 1977, p.10).  Along with this overall decline went mill closures and a shift in the sexual division of labor as men moved from being a minority of 42 per cent in the mills operating in 1961 (Australian Textile Workers Union 1961), to  a 61 per cent majority in 1986 (Australian Bureau of Statistics 1986).

<P>
Both male and female dominated areas of employment were to undergo the agonies of restructuring throughout the 1970's.  The oil crisis and global rationalisation of the car and aluminium industries impacted upon male employment at the same time as female employment was cut  in textiles, clothing and footwear (Hughes 1977; Linge and Mckay 1981; Rich 1987)".

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Plagiarism</FONT>

<P>
Plagiarism is a form of cheating.  In  written work submitted for assessment in the Faculty of Health plagiarism will be regarded as a ground for failure and will lead to disciplinary proceedings under the University Regulations  A lecturer or tutor has the obligation to report immediately all suspected cases of plagiarism to the Dean of the Faculty and the Head of the Department or equivalent, and the Chair of the Faculty Board.

<P>
One kind of plagiarism is failure to acknowledge the source of ideas not your own.  This includes the ideas of other students, those in the study guide and those of your teachers.  Reference must be given to the source of the ideas in the form of a note.

<P>
Another form of plagiarism is the use of the exact words of others without quotation marks or indentation to indicate that the words are quoted.  Such quotations should always be accompanied by an accurate reference to the original source of the quotation.

<P>
The aim of any written work submitted for assessment is to present one's own argument in one's own words.  The use of direct quotations from written or other sources should be kept to a minimum. 

<P>
In saying this, it does not mean to imply that you should not borrow ideas and perspectives from textbooks and other printed or electronic sources.  Naturally, your essays will largely consist of arranging what you have learned from these sources in a relevant and coherent form to address the question you are answering.  What is required simply is that you provide proper citations of any such sources you may use, and that the main argument of your essay be in your own words.
